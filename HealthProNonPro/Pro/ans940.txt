Once treated with antibiotics, the spread of the bacteria stops within 24 
hours. However I would advise to use precautions to further reduce the 
spread of the bacteria. These include making sure that you cover your mouth 
while coughing/sneezing and washing your hands frequently. I hope this 
helps, take care.
