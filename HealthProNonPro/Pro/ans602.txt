If you are a smoker and/or diabetic, then, PAD (peripheral artery disease) 
definitely must be rule out. On the other hand, it is important rule out 
neurological causes of your symptoms due to a lumbar nerve compression. 
Your doctor may recommend ways that you can reduce your risk factors for 
atherosclerosis and peripheral vascular disease. Not all risk factors can 
be changed, but most can be reduced. Also he will order the imaging studies 
(MRI) to rule out a possible nerve compression in the spine.
