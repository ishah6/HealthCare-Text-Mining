Though most breast cancers are not painful, a painful breast lump does not 
rule out the possibility of breast cancer. Most of the painful breast lumps 
are due to benign or inflammatory conditions. Breast infections or 
abscesses, breast cysts, fibroadenomas my all present as painful breast 
lumps.I would advise that you schedule an appointment with your doctor for a 
breast examination. Your doctor may also require an ultrasound, fine needle 
aspiration or a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis.
