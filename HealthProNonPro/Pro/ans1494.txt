The symptoms that you are experiencing suggests of an allergic cause. It is 
difficult to point out the actual source of the allergy and may be due to 
pollen , pollution to animals, pet dander, carpets , dust, new clothes , 
bedsheets etc. I would suggest you to analyze any new item introduced into 
your home that may be the source of this allergy. In the mean time I advice 
you to take any antiallergic medication like cetrizine or allegra which 
will help decrease the allergy symptoms. If you develop symptoms of 
shortness of breath and wheezing you need to go to the nearest ER 
immediately.
