Tylenol is the safest pain medication you can take during pregnancy. You 
may need to take one tablet every 6 hourly. Stay away from ibuprofen and 
other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), such as aspirin and 
naproxen, while you're pregnant. If this does not relieve the pain, you 
will need to schedule an appointment with your dentist.
