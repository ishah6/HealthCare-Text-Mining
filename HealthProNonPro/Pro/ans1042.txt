Seafood allergies are the most common food allergies. Anchovies are a 
histamine-rich food that can trigger an allergic response such as allergic 
asthma. They can also cause flushed skin, rash, swelling of the lips and 
nasal passages, sweating, pallor, nausea, abdominal cramps, rapid pulse, 
confusion, wheezing, convulsions, lightheadedness and fainting. Seafood 
allergies last throughout people's lives, unlike most food allergies that 
children grow out of. Women are more likely to be afflicted with fish 
allergies than men, and it is not uncommon for the onset of fish allergies 
to happen in adulthood. I would suggest you to be careful about everything 
you eat, especially if you are allergic to anchovies and other ingredients 
that may be a hidden in different foods. Reading labels can be life saving.
