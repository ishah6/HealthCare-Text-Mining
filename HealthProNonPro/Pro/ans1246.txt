Thank you for your question. There could be a number of causes for the pain 
that you are experiencing in this area of the tongue. This area of the 
tongue is much more sensitive to irritation in comparison to the surface of 
the tongue. Canker sores, minor abrasions from food, or even irritation 
from wearing a retainer may can result in a lot of pain and discomfort. 
Since you are also experiencing dry mouth, and chapped lips, you may also 
have developed an irritation of your entire mouth. This can occur due to 
bacterial, fungal or even viral infections. We recommend that you have your 
entire mouth examined by your doctor in order to determine what the actual 
cause of your mouth pain. If this is an infection, you can be prescribed an 
oral antibiotic mouth wash to sooth and treat this infection. Please be 
guided accordingly.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
