I suggest you replace your alcohol with a hobby and invest in a book about positive thinking.  The author Joseph Murphy has several good ones like "The Power of Your Subconscious Mind".  Practice positive thinking by repeating to yourself several times each day and night "I always make the right decisions now because God is guiding me now and wonders happen in my life.  I am happy, healthy, sober, wealthy and successful and I radiate goodwill and love to everyone around me.  I know with guidance I walk with confidence and this results in right action."

When you say you always make wrong decisions, you are telling your subconscious mind that you are stupid and you will continue on this path until you change your thoughts.  Thoughts are things.  We create our future by what we think all day long.  Good luck to you!
