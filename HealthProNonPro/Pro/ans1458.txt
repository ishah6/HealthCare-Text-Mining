The problem that you described often is caused by wearing poor fitting 
shoes, fallen arches (flat feet), and plantar fasciitis or overweight, 
these are the 4 most common causes of foot pain in absence of a trauma 
antecedent. Try to wear cushioned footwear, avoid uncomfortable shoes, and 
if you exercise do a warm up before with an adequate stretch, avoid putting 
excessive strain on your feet and if you are overweight you can lose weight 
if you need it. You also may take anti inflammatory medication (“Aleve”, 
“Motrin”) and see if they work relieving the pain. If you try all of the 
above and poor improvement is noted, then I suggest you a consultation with 
a specialist (podiatrist).
