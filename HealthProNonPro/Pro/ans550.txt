I strongly recommend you to have a reevaluation by your cardiologist in the 
view of the characteristics of the chest pain, and once that a possible 
cardiac event is ruled out, then you should have a consultation with an 
orthopedic surgeon to determine if the pain is due to a local muscle or 
bone dysfunction.
