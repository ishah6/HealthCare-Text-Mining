There are many causes of chest pain. They may be due to problems with the 
heart, lungs and stomach. Since you've mentioned symptoms (chest pain, pain 
in neck) that could indicate myocardial infarction or angina, I would 
suggest you to immediately consult your doctor. An electrocardiogram and 
cardiac bio-markers may be helpful in ruling out a heart attack.
