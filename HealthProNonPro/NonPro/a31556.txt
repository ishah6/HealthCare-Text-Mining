Thats a little unhealthy, but here is my advice. I went to Taiwan for 2 months and lost 20 pounds.
I recommend:
More water, NO SODA as in none. Exercise EVERY day, not a lot, but running and cardio. Eat less at a time. If you stuff yourself, your body converts what it considers extra into fat.

good luck!
