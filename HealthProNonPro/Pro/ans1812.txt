Your excessive and prolonged bleeding may be caused by a condition known as 
menometrorrhagia. It can be caused due to hormonal imbalance, 
endometriosis, uterine fibroid and can lead to anemia if not treated.Treatment depends on the cause. I would suggest that you consult with your 
doctor. Investigations like a complete blood count, hormonal studies and 
pelvic ultrasonography may be required to determine the cause. Your doctor 
may put you on a contraceptive pill to induce bleeding in a regular 
schedule and minimize the symptoms.
