Thank you for your question. There is no evidence that supports the fact 
that osteoarthritis of the hands can be caused due to a life long history 
of scoliosis. Given your age, it is possible that the osteoarthritis that 
developed in your hands could be due to the degeneration of articular 
cartilage within between the bones of the hands. You could also be 
suffering from another type of arthritis called rheumatoid arthritis. This 
type of arthritis involves the inflammation and swelling of articular 
joints, particularly smaller ones such as in the hands and toes. We are not 
certain as to which type of arthritis you may be suffering from so it will 
be wise to consult your doctor to have the appropriate diagnostic testing 
performed to arrive at the best possible diagnosis of your condition.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
