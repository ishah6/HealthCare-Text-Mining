Your description may correspond to a Sacroiliitis, this an inflammation of 
the bottom part of the spine, sacro-iliac joints, this may occur due to 
trauma, extreme movements,degenerative arthritis and in some cases is 
associated with some rheumatological conditions as: ankylosing 
spondylitis, Behcet syndrome, Reiter’s syndrome. If you have persistent low 
back pain and sacroiliac pain, the differential diagnoses to be 
considered are: Hip overuse Syndrome, Iliotibial band Syndrome, Lumbosacral 
facet Syndrome, Piriformis Syndrome, Trochanteric bursitis, Lumbosacral 
radiculopathy, Sacroiliac joint infection, Seronegative 
spondyloarthropathy, Reiter Syndrome. Some studies show that sacroiliac 
pain would appear to be at least 13% and perhaps as high a 30% in patients 
with low back and buttock pain. I recommend that you get a thoroughly 
re-evaluation including physical exam and lab and imaging tests to rule out 
some of the conditions mentioned above (seronegative spondyloarthritis, 
Reiter Syndrome).
