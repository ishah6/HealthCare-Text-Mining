The chances of pregnancy would depend how long you have missed your 
periods. When a women does not have her period for 12 consecutive months, a 
diagnosis of menopause can be made, before that she is in the 
peri-menopausal stage in which pregnancy is certainly possible. During 
perimenopausal stage, it is difficult to suggest a good time for home 
pregnancy test as the periods are irregular. I would suggest that you do a 
home pregnancy test at first and if it is negative, then consult your 
doctor for a blood test to determine pregnancy.
