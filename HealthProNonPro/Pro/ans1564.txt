There could be many possibilities about what those bumps could be. If 
you've had unprotected sex, then there's definitely a possibility of STD 
and needs bloodwork to test for it. However in my opinion and by your 
history, it is most possibly due to folliculitis. Whenever the there is 
friction of the hair folicles due to tight clothing or trauma, folliculitis 
develops. No medication is needed other than wearing loose clothing and 
warm compresses. You could also use oral or topical antibiotics (mupirocin) 
help to resolve the folliculitis.
