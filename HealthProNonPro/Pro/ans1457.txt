The problem that you described often is caused by wearing poor fitting 
shoes, fallen arches (flat feet), and plantar fasciitis or overweight, 
these are the 4 most common causes of foot pain in absence of a trauma 
antecedent. Try to wear cushioned footwear, avoid narrow-toe shoes and high 
heels, if you exercise do a warm up before with an adequate stretch, avoid 
putting excessive strain on your feet and lose weight if you need it. You 
also may take anti inflammatory medication (“Aleve”, “Motrin”) and see if 
they work relieving the pain. If you try all of the above and poor 
improvement is noted, then I suggest you a consultation with a specialist 
(podiatrist) to determine also the cause of the excessive sweating.
