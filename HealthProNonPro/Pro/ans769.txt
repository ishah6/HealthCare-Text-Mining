It is the same thing, only what your doctor is telling is more specific. 
Barret's oesophagus is caused by an abnormal change in the characteristic 
of the cells present in the lower oesphagus (also known as metaplasia), 
where the normal squamous cells are replaced by metaplastic columnar cell. 
Depending on the biopsy, the change or metaplasia in the cells can be 
either Low Grade or High Grade Dysplasia. The reason for the great interest 
in Barrett's esophagus is that it is associated with an increased risk of 
cancer of the oesophagus, particularly adenocarcinoma, however this occurs 
in relatively few patients with Barrett's esophagus.
