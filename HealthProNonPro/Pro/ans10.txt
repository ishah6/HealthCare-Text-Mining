A differential that can be considered for your lower abdominal pain is the 
development of adhesion after c-section. Adhesions are fibrous bands that 
form between tissues and organs. After a c-section, internal scar tissue 
may form resulting in lower abdominal and back pain. Other symptoms may 
include abdominal bloating and constipation. Daily self massage will soften 
the tissue dramatically and prevent adhesions. If your symptoms worsen, 
myofascial and craniosacral treatment can also be considered.
