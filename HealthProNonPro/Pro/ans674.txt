It is common to experience foul smelling belches after a heavy meal or if 
one is experiencing symptoms of reflux. I do have to admit that it is 
difficult to pin point the actual cause. Your husband may try dietary 
modifications and antacids to try to relieve the symptoms.If these measures do not help, I would suggest that he see a 
gastroenterologist for an upper GI endoscopy to rule out other causes such 
as a hiatus hernia or gastic outlet obstruction causing the symptoms.
