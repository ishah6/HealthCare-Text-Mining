I understand your concern about abdominal pain during pregnancy. Most cause 
of pain during third trimester before labor is due to physiologic changes 
of the growing uterus. I would however recommend that you see your doctor 
if the pain frequency or severity increases. It is important to rule out 
pain from serious causes such as preterm labour, placental abruption, 
preeclampsia and urinary tract infection.
