lie on your side, upper leg bent and crossed over lower leg for support. Then you do leg lifts with lower leg. if you want to add extra weight to leg, add to your thigh not ankle (better for knee). 

another is side kicks, heel up, stomach in and lift leg as high as poss without letting toes point toward ceiling.  Good luck
