The knock out may have caused you a concussion which is a brain injury that 
may produce headache, altered levels of alertness and unconsciousness. This 
significant blow to the head shakes the brain inside the skull, and 
temporarily prevents the brain from working normally, the blow may be mild, 
moderate or severe. Sometimes a person who has a more serious concussion, 
may develop new symptoms over time and feels worse than before the injury, 
this is “Post Concussive Syndrome”. It is important if over the time you 
start to show Post Concussive Symptoms, call your doctor and get a 
thoroughly neurological evaluation. The post concussive symptoms include: 
difficulty to think, concentrate or remember; headaches or blurry vision; 
becoming angry or anxious for no reason; lack of interest in your usual 
activities, changes in your sex drive, dizziness, lightheadedness or 
unsteadiness that makes difficult for you to walk or standing. It is 
difficult to predict the outcome in terms of neurologic sequels, some 
people feel normal again in a few hours after a concussion while others 
have symptoms and sequels for weeks or months, it depends on each case in 
particular and also depends on the severity of the blow.
