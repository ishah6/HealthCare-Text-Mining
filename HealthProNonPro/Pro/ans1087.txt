Sudafed contains phenylephrine and is considered safe. While excretion into 
breast milk is unknown, it is unlikely to be excreted into breast milk in 
large quantities due to its poor bioavailability. The effect of phenyl­ 
ephrine on milk production and supply is also unknown; therefore, this 
medication should be used with caution in women with limited milk 
production. An alternative would be nasal decongestants which due to their 
local action and poor systemic absorption are preferred over systemic oral 
decongestants in breast feeding mothers.
