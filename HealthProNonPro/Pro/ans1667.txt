Unfortunately, the tibial-fibula fracture non-union is a complication that 
may present in several cases, and is usually treated with bone grafting 
techniques. The most used and common is to obtain bone from the same 
patient hip, as done in your case. Fracture healing does not mean full 
function, and residual weakness, pain, and limitations in function are 
common, even in appropriately treated patients with clinically successful 
outcomes. In your case it is very important to follow to the letter the 
directions of the surgeon and the rehab process, in the view that your age, 
calcium level, physical activity and the unpredictable outcome of this type 
of problem itself (tibial non union treated with bone grafting).
