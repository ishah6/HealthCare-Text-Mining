I can understand your anxiety. There could be several factors that may be 
causing your delayed or irregular periods. Once pregnancy is ruled out, we 
may need to look af other factors.i) It is often seen that once a contraceptive pill is stopped, it usually 
takes 3-4 months before the periods become regular.ii) You have also mentioned that you are under a lot of stress. This could 
also explain why you missed your periods. Stress may cause delayed or 
irregular periods.iii) Low calorific intake : Dieting or taking less amount of calories could 
also be another factor.I would advise that you see your doctor for a physical examination and 
history. Your doctor may also advise several blood test and imaging studies 
(thyroid, complete blood count, hormonal studies and ultrasound of the 
pelvis) to determine the cause of delayed periods. I hope the information 
helps.
