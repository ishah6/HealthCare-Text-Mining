If you are feeling stressed lately, you can go ahead and try a relaxing 
massage. Your mild scoliosis is not a contraindication to do so. One of the 
most effective methods of helping muscle tension is receiving a massage. 
Massage therapy has been a proven technique for alleviating the strains, 
stress, and tensions of the muscles. Deep tissue massages are able to get 
deep into the muscle, thereby massaging the source of the tension. 
Exercising is also a good way to release the tension in the muscles, and 
the mind will also feel the positive effects of physical exercise. 
Relaxation techniques and yoga can also contribute to alleviating tension 
in the muscles. By keeping the muscles loose, the tension is less likely to 
build up. Stretching the muscles is also a great way to help smooth and 
release the tension.
