There are several causes of swollen ankles and feet, generally they are not 
cause for concern, particularly if you have been standing or walking a lot. 
But feet and ankles that stay swollen or are accompanied by other symptoms 
could indicate a serious health problem. For example, swelling of the 
ankles and feet is often an early symptom of venous insufficiency, a 
condition in which blood inadequately moves up the veins from the legs and 
feet up to the heart. Chronic venous insufficiency can lead to skin 
changes, skin ulcers, and infection. If you experience signs of venous 
insufficiency you should see your doctor.
