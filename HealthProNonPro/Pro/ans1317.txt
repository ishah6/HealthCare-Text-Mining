The burning sensation that you described in your LLQ, most likely 
correspond to a Meralgia Paresthetica, this is a type of Neuropathy, which 
produces a pain occurring from a peripheral nerve inflammation not 
associated with the spinal cord called Neuritis. The pain in the upper 
anterior part of the hip and/or LLQ may radiate to the skin of the stomach, 
resulting from inflammation of a sensory nerve that goes near the Iliac 
crest and the superficial part of the hip. This type of pain tends to 
involve just a limited area only. The suggested strategy would be: 
conservative therapy, such as physical therapy, weight reduction to 
decrease abdominal girth, local moist heat application, Complex B vitamin, 
analgesics, and anti-inflammatory drugs as Ibuprofen and avoid wearing 
constrictive garments, belts, or braces that impart excessive focal 
pressure at the lateral aspect of the affected hip. If does not get better 
with these measures it is strongly recommend to be evaluated by a 
orthopedic surgeon and maybe consider the local corticosteroid injection 
which may provide more chronic relief of symptoms. You have to be patient 
because the improvement in these cases does not occur overnight. Regarding 
the bowel movements and nausea you better consult a Gastroenterologist.
