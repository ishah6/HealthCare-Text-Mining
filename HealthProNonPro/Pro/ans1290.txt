Thank you for your question. Your bout of food poisoning could have 
precipitated your constipation for the last two days. This is probably due 
to the inflammation of your intestines sustained due to the infection. This 
should resolve in a few days. In order to assist in having a bowel 
movement, we recommend that you maintain adequate hydration by drinking 
copious amounts of water. Furthermore, increasing your dietary fibre will 
also help. We do not recommend taking any stool softeners or laxatives at 
this point as it has only been two days. If your do not have a bowel 
movement in 4-5 days, we recommend that you speak to your doctor about this 
to be prescribed an appropriate medication to assist you to have a bowel 
movement.
