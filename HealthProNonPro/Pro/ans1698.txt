Very high levels of ALT are usually due to acute hepatitis, often due to a 
virus infection. Levels of ALT may also be markedly elevated as a result of 
exposure to drugs or other substances that are toxic to the liver as well 
as in conditions that cause decreased blood flow (ischemia) to the liver. 
It is difficult to say what is the cause of your brother's elevated ALT and 
bilirubin. A complete medical history is the single most important part of 
the evaluation of the patient with elevated LFTs. The decision to pursue 
specific testing depends on the pattern of abnormalities, and suggestive 
features obtained from the history and physical examination.
