Ummm.....its not your fault!!!
Hes a drunk and thats why he keeps going limp. Hes got what they call "whiskey d*ck". His brain is too soaked in booze causign him to go limp. The brain can function correctly for sexual stimulation when its filled to the brim with the drinkie!!
Tell him to ease up on the sauce and then maybe you both might have some good sex. Good Grief.
