I do understand your concern that your swollen glands may affect your baby. 
It is most probable that the swelling is caused by a viral cold/flu. 
Usually no treatment is required other than increased fluid intake, rest 
and application of warm compresses to help alleviate the pain and 
congestion.However, if you have a temperature of the swelling does not subside, I 
would advise that you consult your doctor. Since you are 5 months pregnant, 
there is less risk of the infection harming the baby.
