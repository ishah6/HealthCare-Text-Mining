Thank you for your question. If you are looking to cut down on the sodium 
in your diet the best way is to remove added salt in your diet. 
Furthermore, juices, sodas, and artificially flavoured drinks contain added 
sodium in addition to sugar, should be removed from your diet as well. Try 
to avoid eating highly processed foods, deli meats, and take out meals as 
they too, contain a lot of sodium. This should help reduce the amount 
sodium in your diet.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
