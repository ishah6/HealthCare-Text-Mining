You are now in the Rehab phase IVa between 2 months to 3 months; at this 
point you may have some pain that may be treated with TENS, ice/warm 
compresses and anti inflammatory medication. The emphasis will be in 
finalizing the ROM (range of motion movements) and increase progressive 
resistance exercises. Possibly you will be instructed in the use of 
Thera-tubing and/or weight lifting exercises that are performed for the 
entire shoulder girdle strengthening and stabilization. After this phase 
you will be in the phase IVb that goes from the third to the fourth months 
after the SLAP, you will continue with a more aggressive 
shoulder-stretching program as indicated. You will increase the resistive 
strengthening program to include heavier weight with any and all lifts as 
tolerated. Generally it takes 3-4 four months for return to full activity. 
A throwing progression for dominant arm athletes will not begin prior to 4 
months postoperatory. This timeframe is highly unpredictable and will vary 
greatly between each individual patient. Bracing may be used for return to 
contact or collision sports up to 6 months post-op. It is recommended that 
you follow-up monthly or as needed between 4 an 6 months post-op. You are 
supposed to return at 6 months post-op for the final time to see the 
physician and the therapist. Usually a Cybex strength evaluation is 
performed at this time as well as at 1 year post-operative.
