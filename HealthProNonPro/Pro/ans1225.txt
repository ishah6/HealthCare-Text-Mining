Thank you for your question. The hymen is a membranous structure that is 
formed during the development of the female fetus and covers the vaginal 
opening. The hymen can have many different configurations from being 
completely imperforate, to microperforate, and septate. The only way of 
determining if the hymen is intact is by conducting a pelvic exam with 
trained physician. If you have never had sexual intercourse, or have never 
have had a pelvic exam or inserted any object into you vagina, then the 
chances of your hymen being intact are good. You need not be concerned.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
