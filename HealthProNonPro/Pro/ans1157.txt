Thank you for your question. In very young infants, the finger nails are 
very thin and may appear flattened compared to the finger nails of adults. 
This should not be a cause for concern. However, there is a condition 
called Koilonychia, or spoon nails, wherein the finger nails not only 
flatten, but become thin and covex shaped like spoons. This is a symptom of 
iron deficiency anemia. Should you notice this type of change in your 
child, please have your doctor examine your baby and start a diagnostic 
investigation for anemia.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
