I understand your concern about bleeding due to miscarriage. Many 
miscarriages occur so early in pregnancy that a woman doesn't even know 
she's pregnant. Most miscarriages occur before the 12th week of pregnancy. 
Though bleeding is sometimes seen with pregnancy, it is not common for the 
bleeding to continue for a week. I would suggest first to consult your 
Gynecologist to rule out miscarriage. Your doctor may repeat the beta HCG 
test to see if the levels are rising. A decrease in the level of beta HCG 
may require an ultrasound to rule out a miscarriage.
