The most probable cause could be due to leg cramps caused by overuse of the 
muscles/exercise, standing for long periods of time, dehydration and 
deficiency of calcium, potassium and other minerals in the body. You may 
relieve the pain by adequate hydration, mild stretching of the muscles, 
health diet and avoiding coffee and tea at bedtime. If the pain persists 
you doctor may prescribe a muscle relaxant to decrease the symptoms.
