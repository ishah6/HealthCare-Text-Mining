It is unclear what causes alopecia areata. Theories range from genetic to 
autoimmmune factors. The hair follicles remain alive and are ready to 
resume normal hair production whenever they receive the appropriate signal. 
In all cases, hair regrowth may occur even without treatment and even after 
many years. You have a few treatment options like steroid topical 
injections or topical applications, minoxidil or anthralin ointment. You 
may need to consult a dermatologist to see which medication would suit you 
better. I hope this helps, take care.
