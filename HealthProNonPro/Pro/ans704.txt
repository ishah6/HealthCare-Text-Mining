It is difficult for me to say whether your baby will inherit his father's 
condition. Many heart diseases have an autosomal dominant transmission, 
that mean that half of the family members will carry the defective gene. 
But this does not mean that your baby will have features of the disease as 
these genes have variable expressions. You may want to attend a genetic 
counselling for more information. Take care.
