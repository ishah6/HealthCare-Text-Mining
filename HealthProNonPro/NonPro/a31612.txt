Go to the drugstore and get some motion sickness bands.  They work wonders and are drug and side effect free.  You wear them on your wrists.  They have a small ball that sits on the insides of both wrist on a nerve that goes to your stomach.  I was told to use them when I was pregnant and they worked GREAT!  And they dont cost much at all.
