Genital itching can be a symptom of many conditions which may include jock 
itch, skin irritation due to contact dermatitis and sexually transmitted 
diseases. I would definitely suggest that you see a health-care 
professional to rule out sexually transmitted disease as the cause of 
genital itching. I would also advise that you wash your penis well, 
including the area under the foreskin, keep the area dry, wear loose, 
natural-fiber underwear and clothing and avoid unprotected sex.
