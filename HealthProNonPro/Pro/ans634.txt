In my opinion, you should consult your doctor for accurate diagnosis of the 
condition and specific treatment of the symptoms. Although it seems to be a 
viral infection from the above mentioned description, you may need to 
consult with your doctor. Viral flu usually runs it course in 7-10 days and 
no treatment is required.
