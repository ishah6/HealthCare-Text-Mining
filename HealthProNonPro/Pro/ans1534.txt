There are many causes of irregular periods with polycystic ovarian syndrome 
being one of them. The other causes could be thyroid hormone problems and 
alterations in FSH/LH levels. I would not be worried just yet and would 
advise you to monitor your periods. If the pain worsens and you continue 
having irregular periods, then you may need an evaluation by an 
obstetrician.
