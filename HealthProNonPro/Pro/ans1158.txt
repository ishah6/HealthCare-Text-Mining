Thank you for your question. It is a possibility that the problem is not 
with you but actually with your husband. It may be that the tissue of his 
glans penis and foreskin are very sensitive and prone to abrasion. This can 
be seen in uncircumcised men more than those who have had a circumcision. 
Furthermore, if he has been using any topical medication on his penis, this 
could also be increasing the sensitive. Certain personal lubricants can 
actually irritate some persons as they may have allergies. We recommend 
that your husband consult his doctor in order to be examined to determine 
if his abrasions are due to excess sensitivity of the penile tissue.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
