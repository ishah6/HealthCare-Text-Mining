First generation antihistamines are considered safe to use during 
pregnancy, though data for the second generation antihistamine (non 
sedating) are few.Second generation antihistamines are preferred because they do not cause 
central nervous system adverse effects (eg, drowsiness). Examples of 
second-generation antihistamines are cetirizine, desloratadine, 
fexofenadine, and loratadine. I would advise you to consult your doctor for 
further information regarding the use of antihistamines in pregnancy.
