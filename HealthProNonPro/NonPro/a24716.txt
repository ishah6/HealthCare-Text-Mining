Losing weight by sweating it off is a temporary wieght loss. All youre doing is removing water from the body by sweating it off. This is not a recommended way of losing weight because it can cause dehydration, you can lose valuable minerals that can lead to severe cramping, and it is only temporary. We would do this to make weight for a wrestling match. It is very draining on the body and not safe.
