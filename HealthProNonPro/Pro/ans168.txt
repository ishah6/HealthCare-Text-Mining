Breast tenderness, nausea and tiredness are some of the sign that are 
present during pregnancy. However the only way to confirm pregnancy is by 
doing a home pregnancy test. I would advise you to do the test if you've 
missed your periods. The best time for the test is in the morning with the 
first urine sample. I hope this helps, take care.
