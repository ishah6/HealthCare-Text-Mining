Reflux esophagitis results from the combination of excessive 
gastroesophageal reflux of gastric juice and impaired esophageal clearance 
of the refluxate. Minimal, but sensible, therapy for GERD patients is 
comprised of lifestyle modification, dietary modification, as needed 
antacid use, over-the-counter H2 receptor antagonists, and over-the-counter 
proton pump inhibitors. Lifestyle modifications are aimed at enhancing 
esophageal acid clearance, minimizing the incidence of reflux events, or 
both as with cessation of smoking and avoidance of late meals:Head of bed elevation, which can be achieved either by putting 6- to 8-inch 
blocks under the legs at the head of the bed or a Styrofoam wedge under the 
mattress.Dietary modification may be helpful but prohibition of many enjoyable foods 
virtually ensures noncompliance. It is more practical to suggest avoidance 
of a core group of reflux-inducing foods (fatty foods, chocolate, 
peppermint, and excessive alcohol, which may reduce lower esophageal 
sphincter pressure) and then to suggest that the patient selectively avoid 
foods known to cause symptoms. As an example, a number of beverages have a 
very acidic pH and can exacerbate symptoms. These include colas, red wine, 
and orange juiceRefraining from assuming a supine position after meals and avoidance of 
meals before bedtime, both of which will minimize reflux.Avoidance of tight fitting garments, which reduces reflux by decreasing the 
stress on a weak sphincter.Promotion of salivation by either chewing gum or use of oral lozenges may 
also be helpful in mild heartburn. Salivation neutralizes refluxed acid, 
thereby increasing the rate of esophageal acid clearance.Restriction of alcohol use and elimination of smoking; smoking is 
deleterious in part because it diminishes salivation.
