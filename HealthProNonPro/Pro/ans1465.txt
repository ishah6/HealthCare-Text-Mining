The recovery time for an anal abscess will differ in every individual. 
Recovery depends on the overall health of the person and whether there a 
secondary infection develops or not. It usually takes 2-4 months for an 
abscess to meal. There may be a risk of developing a fistula but there is 
really no way to predict if this will occur.
