The itching could be a symptom of a sexually transmitted infection or 
contact dermatitis due to an irritant. I would however advise you to get 
yourself check for the presence of an infection and treat accordingly. You 
may also take measures to relieve the symptoms like wearing cotton 
underwear, adequate hydration and avoid putting creams/perfume in the 
affected area.
