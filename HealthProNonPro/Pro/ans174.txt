Celiac disease is an immune-mediated disease that results from increased 
sensitivity to gluten proteins. Celiac disease is genetically transmitted. 
You may have at 10% increased risk to celiac disease as compared to normal 
population. It is important for your GP to investigate you for celiac 
disease. It is seen that women with celiac disease might not absorb folic 
acid efficiently which may lead to miscarriages. Also there is an increased 
incidence of reproductive disorders in celiac disease. Diagnosis will 
depend on a high degree of suspicion, serologic antibody detection, 
intestinal biopsy and clinical improvement on a gluten free diet. Treatment 
includes a gluten free diet and immunosuppressive therapy with 
corticosteroids.
