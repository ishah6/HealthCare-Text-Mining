Your symptoms may have been caused by gastroenteritis. This is usually 
infective in origin, especially with common viruses and bacteria. It is 
usually self-limited and will run its own course. If symptoms are not 
improving, I would advise attending your family doctor as you may require 
anti-nausea medication.
