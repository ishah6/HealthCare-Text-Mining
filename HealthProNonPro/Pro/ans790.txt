It is very difficult to say whether your periods will return to the same as 
it was before pregnancy. This may be different from mother to mother. A 
breastfeeding mom may not get regular periods until after 5-6 months. If 
you want to adjust your periods, then you may need to talk to your obgyn 
doctor who may put you on a hormonal treatment.
