In my opinion your symptoms of burning sensation of the eyes, watering and 
redness are typical of a conjunctival reaction to allergens also called 
allergic keratoconjuctivitis . Inflammation causes increased congestion of 
the eyes associated with increased watering. This condition is usually 
seasonal and is caused by allergy to pollens, dust mites, molds, dander and 
pets.Treatment of choice would be topical antihistamine eye drops and mast cell 
stabilizer medication. Your doctor may even prescribe you a short course of 
topical steroid to tide over the acute phase. Oral antihistamine can also 
be used to alleviate the symptoms.
