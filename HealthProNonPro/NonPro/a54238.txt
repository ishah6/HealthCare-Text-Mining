Well, depends on what activities you partake in, and what you weigh now, if you are extremely sedintary, you can go for about 4 to 6 weeks, if you are active, you might make 10 to 12 days, but by 4 or 5 you will be so weak you will go into shock, drinking fluids will only worsen the effects, because you will end up with diarrea, or more to the point, you will pi$$ out your a$$, this will cause dehydration, which will only worsen the effects or starvation. also your stomach will produce more acid, which will cause ulcers, and your body will begin to eat its self, if you want to see extreme effects of starvation, look up pictures from Auchwich, the German death camp from WWII, there you will see where starvation will lead you.
