Blood and pain in stools could be the result of hemorrhoids, anal fissures 
or an underlying gastrointestinal disorder like inflammatory bowel disease 
(IBD), diverticulitis. In my opinion, it would be advisable to get yourself 
examined by a doctor or a gastroenterologist. Usually an anoscopy may be 
all that is required for diagnosis. A colonoscopy may be done for IBD or 
diverticulitis. Treatment will depend on the cause. You may also try to 
increase dietary fiber intake if you have constipation, which is usually 
the case if suffering from hemorrhoids and anal fissures.
