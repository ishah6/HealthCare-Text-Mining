The causes of back pain can usually be diagnosed with a detailed 
description of the symptoms, along with medical history and possibly 
diagnostic testing,in your case they should include urine tests in the view 
of the characteristics of your pelvic pain; this will usually lead to a 
diagnosis of a general cause (such as back strain, urinary infection), or a 
specific condition (such as a bulging disc). The majority of episodes of 
acute back pain are due to a muscular strain and these will usually resolve 
with time because muscles have a good blood supply to bring the necessary 
nutrients and proteins for healing to take place. If the low back pain 
lasts longer than three months, or you have mostly radiation of the pain to 
the leg, a more specific problem for the pain should be sought. There are 
several very common causes of low back pain and leg pain: in young 
individuals, the discs may be the cause and in older persons, the 
osteoarthritis or problems in the facet joints may be the culprit. I 
strongly recommend you to have a consultation with your PCP and rule out 
gynecologic, urinary and of course spine causes of your symptoms.
