ive heard several times that the amount of sleep each individual requires is based on a number of factors, some of which include age, weight, and even diet. everyone has different schedules, and each one is independent to one another depending on their own individual health.<br />
im not one to set an example, but i average anywhere from 5-7 hours of sleep on a regular basis. sometimes my body requires more, sometimes less, but it seems to balance out and i never feel as though im suffering from lack, or over abundance, of sleep.<br />
ive included a yahoo! health article to help shed light on some of your own personal sleep habits.
