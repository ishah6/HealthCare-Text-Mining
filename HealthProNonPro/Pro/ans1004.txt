Pregnancy may be a possibility and you may have to do a urine pregnancy 
test to confirm it. Your delayed period may also be due to emotional stress 
and hormonal imbalance causing an anovulatory cycle. If the urine pregnancy 
test is negative and you still have not got your periods, I suggest that 
you consult your doctor for further tests.
