I can see why you are hurting from this but come on if it is the 6th time it has happened, you need to check yourself. You need to re think your relationships. It seems like you are the cause of the heart aches. Maybe you should chill out on the dating for awhile and let things happen as they happen. If not you will end up like my loser of a cousin. 32 single and miserable. But I do hope that you find happiness.
