The swallowing tube (esophagus) passes into the stomach through the 
esophageal hiatus (the opening in the muscle wall below the lungs (the 
diaphragm). A hiatal hernia occurs when the upper part of your stomach 
bulges up through the hiatus into your chest cavity. Most hiatal hernias 
don't cause problems or require treatment. But a large hiatal hernia can 
cause food and stomach acid to back up into your esophagus (acid reflux), 
leading to heartburn and chest pain. The possible causes are: injury to the 
area, being born with a large hiatus, persistent and intense pressure on 
the surrounding muscles, such as coughing, vomiting, and straining during 
the bowel movements or lifting heavy objects.
