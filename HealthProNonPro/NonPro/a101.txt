Heres a simple set of exercises that I do daily: Slowly look as far as you (comfortably) can up, and then down, then back up, going back five or so times.  Then go left and right, then diagonally between upper right & lower left and between upper left & lower right.  Then go clockwise around the edge of your vision, twice slowly, then three times quickly.  Then the same thing but counterclockwise.  Finish off by holding up your thumb in front of you, and switching back and forth a few times between focusing on your thumb and focusing on a more distant object (such as the wall).  Only your eyes should move, not the rest of your head.  At first when you are learning these exercises, try putting your hand on your forehead and make sure that you are not tensing your forehead as you move your eyes. 
 
If youre interested in learning more eye yoga, theres an excellent video called "Yoga For Your Eyes."  (With whom I have no affiliation, except as a satisfied customer.) 
 
There is a limit to what these kinds of techniques can achieve, of course, but theyre easy and free so its worth a shot.
