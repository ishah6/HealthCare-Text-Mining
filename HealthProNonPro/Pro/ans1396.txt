The most common cause of primary headaches are due to migraines or tension 
type headache. Migraine headache can cause intense throbbing or pulsing in 
one area of the head. It is commonly accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and 
extreme sensitivity to light and sound. Migraine attacks can cause 
significant pain for hours to days. Tension headache, which is generally a 
diffuse, mild to moderate pain that's often described as feeling like a 
tight band around your head. A tension headache is the most common type of 
headache. Some of the general measures you can take for headaches are to 
eliminate stress, avoid smoking, coffee, alcohol, relaxation therapy & 
yoga. Analgesics may be required if the pain does not subside. If your 
headache gets worse or is present when you wake in the morning, I would 
suggest you to see your GP.
