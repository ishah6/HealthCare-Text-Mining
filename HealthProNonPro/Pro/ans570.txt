I understand your concern. Diarrhea is very common in infants and most 
likely is caused by a viral infection. Usually we don’t prefer to give 
patients of this age anti-diarrhea medications since her body would 
regulate by itself. However I would definitely suggest you to watch for 
Dehydration which is a serious complication. Watch for signs of Decreased 
urination like fewer wet infant diapers than usual in a 24 hour period, 
Infant has dry eyes and crying with few tears or no tears, High fever, 
sunken abdomen, Infant is less active than usual. If any of these symptoms 
are noted seek immediate attention.
