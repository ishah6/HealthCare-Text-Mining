Even though it is possible to have an overdose of vitamin D, the phenomenon 
is very rare. You may need to take a lot of vitamin D in order to reach 
toxic levels. If you are suffering from health problems such as liver of 
kidney problems or are using drugs like thiazide diuretics, you may be 
prone to vitamin D toxicity. Alkaline Phosphatases are a group of enzymes 
found primarily the liver and bone. Increased levels of vitamin D can lower 
Alkaline Phosphatase levels in the body causing loss of teeth, bone 
fractures and bone pain. I do know that you are concerned because of what 
you've read on the internet. I would like to assure you that vitamin D 
toxicity is unlikely when you receive therapeutic dosages. I hope the 
information helps, take care.
