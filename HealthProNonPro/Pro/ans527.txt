I do understand your concern. The problems of speech that you are facing is 
due to dysarthria which could be due to many conditions. However that most 
likely cause of slurred speech in your case would be the anti anxiety 
medication. Medication like xanax and benzodiazepines may cause slurring of 
speech, confusion and disorientation.
