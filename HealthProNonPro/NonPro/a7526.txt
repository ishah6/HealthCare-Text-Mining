This is actually a very good question and you have nothing to be sorry about as far as asking it. Periods differ from person to person, I have some good periods and some bad, bottom line is you learn what is best for you as far as how horrible they are, for me I cannot wear tampons I find they make my cramps much worse so I wear pads.
