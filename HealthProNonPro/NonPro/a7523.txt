Well mine was horrible! It was soooo bad that i used to call off work or I wouldnt go to school when my monthly came. I would get severe cramps, headaches, backaches, vomiting, and chills but once i had my first baby I didnt know what a cramp or any of the above were. The best medicine that helped me when I was in pain was Pamprin and Thermalcare heat pads for cramps but dont rush cause it aint nothing to be excited about!
