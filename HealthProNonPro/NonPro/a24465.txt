Yes, its possible! Different people have different tastes, and believe me, Ive seen thin men go after big-sized women! Some people are attracted to their direct opposites (in size), and thats normal but harder to find than the normal lovebirds you see on the road. I think itll be a good change since most people are trying to look thin and fragile these days.
