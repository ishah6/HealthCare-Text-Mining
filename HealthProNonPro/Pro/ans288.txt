Eye floaters develop when the viterous fluid in the eye condenses. In a 
majority of patients these floaters are benign and no treatment is 
required. However I would advise you to get your eyes examined by an 
ophthalmologist to rule out other serious causes of floaters such as 
vitreous bleeding or hemorrhage, retinal detachment or diabetic retinopathy.
