I do understand that your pregnancy symptoms are causing you concern. 
Mirena coil is very effective though no contraceptive method is 100% 
effective, I would suggest that you do a home pregnancy test to confirm the 
diagnosis. Removal of the coil could interrupt the pregnancy causing 
miscarriage in early pregnancy or result in ectopic pregnancy. In the end you will need to be evaluated by your doctor/gynecologist to 
determine whether you are pregnant or not and the option to remove the coil 
if you are pregnant.
