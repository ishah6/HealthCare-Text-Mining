I do understand you concern about testicular trauma. A varicocele is formed 
when the veins along the spermatic cord enlarge due to defective flow. They 
develop slowly and may present as painless scrotal swelling.I do not think you have a varicocele. However, your doctor may need to rule 
out blunt trauma of the testicle which may present as a hematocele or a 
ruptured testis. I would advise you to consult your doctor for a thorough 
physical examination and scrotal ultrasonography or doppler studies if 
required.Treatment will depend on the extent of scrotal injury. Conservative 
management includes scrotal support, non steroidal anti-inflammatory 
medication, ice packs and bed rest. Hematocele may often require surgical 
exploration. I hope the information help you.
