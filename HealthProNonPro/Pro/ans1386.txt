The Medifast program is designed as a low-calorie, high protein weight loss 
plan that may help to burn fat over an extended period of time. Since it 
does not make use of diet pills and other potentially harmful drugs, the 
plan may be safer for individuals who simply want to cut back on unhealthy 
foods and reduce the amount of junk food in the diet. The Medifast plan 
encourages dieters to ‘eat' six meals per day; five of these are Medifast 
Meals, while one is defined as a ‘Lean & Green Meal' that dieters can put 
together on their own. The program allows dieters to eat every few hours to 
keep blood sugar level stable, and provide a steady source of energy. This 
concept offers many benefits including:Reduced hunger pangs No extreme cravings for a particular food Easier to plan a day's worth of food Reduced risk of unnecessary snacking Reduced chances of preoccupation with food and dieting.Losing weight is essentially a mathematical formula: When you cut calories 
sufficiently, you will lose weight. Medifast supposedly cuts calories from 
the diet while maintaining the satiety levels. Once a weight loss goal has 
been reached, the diet then transitions to a maintenance phase which aims 
to help dieters adjust to eating more calories, controlling portions, and 
choosing and preparing healthy foods.
