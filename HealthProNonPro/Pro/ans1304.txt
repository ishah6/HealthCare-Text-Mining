The antibiotics should start showing results in 24 - 48 hours after taking 
the drug. Though it may take 5-6 days for you to feel better. You should 
never stop the antibiotic or change into another one on your own. Consult 
your doctor if you don't feel better within the next 2-3 days. Throat 
lozenges containing mild anesthetics and warm saline gargles may help 
relieve your sore throat.
