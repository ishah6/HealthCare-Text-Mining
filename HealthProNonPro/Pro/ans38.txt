Abdominoplasty, "Tummy tuck," involves surgically removing excess skin and 
fat from the middle and lower part of the abdomen and sometimes tightening 
the abdominal muscles.Although most plastic surgeons and specialists agree that it is best to 
have this surgery performed after pregnancy, there are many women who do 
have pregnancies after tummy tuck surgery without experiencing any problems 
throughout the whole procedure. The newborn baby's health is generally not 
complicated because of abdominoplasty surgery.
