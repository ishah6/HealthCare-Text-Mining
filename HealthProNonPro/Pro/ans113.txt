Apple cider vinegar has come into the limelight recently for being helpful 
as a health tonic. Apple cider vinegar has shown some benefits though more 
studies need to be done. The positive effects of apple cider vinegar are :i) Apple cider vinegar may help lower glucose levels and thus may benefit 
patients with diabetes.ii) A study in rats has shown evidence that vinegar could lower 
cholesterol. Another study also found that vinegar could lower high blood 
pressure. People who took a vinegar in their salads have been found to have 
a lower risk of heart disease.iii) A few laboratory studies have found that vinegar may be able to kill 
cancer cells or slow their growth.iv) Apple cider vinegar may also help with weight lossThere is no concrete evidence that apple cider vinegar is beneficial and 
even less information on the appropriate dosages. Largely people take two 
teaspoons a day mixed in a glass of water or juice. Higher dosages of apple 
cider vinegar may cause lowering of potassium levels in the body. If 
someone has a low potassium level or osteoporosis, they may need to talk to 
their doctor before using apple cider vinegar. Apple cider vinegar may also 
theoretically interact with drugs such as diuretics and medications for 
diabetes and heart disease. Apple cider vinegar also has chromium, which 
can alter insulin levels, thus must be used with caution in diabetic 
patients. I hope the information helps, ake care.
