Seeing blood in the toilet, on the outside of your stool, or with wiping 
after a bowel movement is common. Fortunately, most of the causes of such 
rectal bleeding are not life-threatening; common causes include hemorrhoids 
and anal fissures. However, the only way to be certain of the cause is to 
be evaluated by a healthcare provider. If your symptoms continue for a 
period of time consult your doctor for a rectal examination, anoscopy or a 
colonoscopy.
