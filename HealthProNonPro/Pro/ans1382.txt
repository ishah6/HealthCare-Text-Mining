The main aim in the treatment of diabetes is to achieve an A1C level of <7 
percent. Glycemic control can prevent cardiovascular morbidity and minimize 
risks for retinopathy, nephropathy, and neuropathy. You have mentioned that 
your father is currently on galvus (vildagliptin) and neodipar (metformin). 
Failure of initial therapy with lifestyle intervention and metformin may 
require an additional second oral or injectable agent, including insulin.Factors that can contribuite to worsening glycemic control are:i) Decreased compliance with diet, exercise, or the medical regimen or 
weight gain.ii) An underlying illness or an indigestion of the oral drugs.iii) Progression of the underlying disease process including insulin 
resistance and deficient insulin secretion causing type 2 diabetes.I would suggest that your father consult his doctor or preferably an 
endocrinologist/diabetologist to see whether insulin is warranted in his 
case. Insulin is a reasonable choice for initial therapy in patients who 
present with symptomatic or poorly controlled diabetes, and is the 
preferred second-line medication for patients with A1C >8.5 percent or with 
symptoms of hyperglycemia despite initial management with meformin and 
lifestyle interventions.
