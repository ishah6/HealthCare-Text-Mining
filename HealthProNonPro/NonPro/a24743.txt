Some pyrite is metastable and may alter to melanterite, which contains sulfuric acid. Always wash hands after handling, especially decrepitated material. Avoid inhaling dust when handling or breaking. Never lick or ingest.
In the opinion of the MontÃ©rÃ©gie Public Health Department, the quantities of sulfuric acid are too minute to cause health problems.
