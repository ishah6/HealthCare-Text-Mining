Breast cancer in men is extremely rare. Less than 1% of all breast cancers 
occur in men. Breast cancer is most commonly diagnosed in men over 60. The 
most common sign of breast cancer in men is a firm, nonpainful mass located 
just below the nipple. Other changes include ulceration of the skin, 
puckering or dimpling, redness or scaling of the nipple, or retraction 
(turning inward) of the nipple. Bloody or opaque discharge from the nipple 
may also occur.
