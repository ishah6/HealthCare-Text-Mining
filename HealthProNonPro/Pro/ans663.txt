Irregular bleeding is sometimes seen with depo use and may not necessarily 
be due to the antibiotics. It usually takes up to a year for the bleeding 
to stop completely. You may wait it out, until the bleeding stops or visit 
your doctor for some medication to stop the bleeding in case it becomes 
worse or the blood loss affects your health condition. I hope you find the 
information useful.
