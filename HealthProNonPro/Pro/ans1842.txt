Your symptoms could be due to viral flu for which no treatment is required. 
Your symptoms should subside on its own within 7-10 days. You can take 
advil or motrin for the symptoms of pain. Also steam inhalation or a hot 
shower will help relieve your symptoms. However, if your symptoms worsen, 
or you develop a fever or cough, you may need to see your health-care 
provider for further evaluation and appropriate antibiotics.
