Symptoms of sensation of sand in the eyes could be caused due to dry eye, a 
condition that results from an inability of the tears to sufficiently 
lubricate the eye. Dry eye is often part of the normal aging changes of the 
body. However, it can be exacerbated or accentuated by sun, wind, cold, 
indoor heaters or air conditioners and computer screens. Treatments include 
avoiding smoke, cold or dry rooms and prolonged computer use. Topical 
lubricants, such as artificial tears can also be used. Severe dry eye, 
however, may require the use of topical steroids, ointments, cyclosporin or 
placement of punctual plugs.
