The high tibial osteotomy has a rehabilitation protocol that must be 
followed to guarantee the success of the operation. The first 4 weeks you 
progress from non weight bearing using crutches to full weight bearing with 
crutches and wearing a brace locked in extension. Use of the CPM as 
tolerated from 0 to 90 degrees of flexion out of the brace.. Ankle pumps 
and calf/hamstring stretches. From 4 to 6 weeks, begin to normalize gait 
pattern without crutches, the brace will be unlocked for ambulation and 
removed for sleeping, discontinue CPM, initiate stationary bike exercises 
and with low resistance. From week 6 to 3 months: normalized gait, no more 
brace, mini-squats, leg press, balance activities and increase resistance 
on the bike. And finally from 3 months to 9 months: full weight bearing 
with normal gait, full range of motion, you can begin treadmill, swimming, 
walking and other sport-specific activities. As you see possibly what you 
need now is a physical therapy program aimed to condition and strenghten 
your leg muscles.
