This is a very difficult phase that you are going through, and I do 
understand your concern. The period of time you should wait before taking 
an HIV test will depend on the type of test that you are taking. In the 
majority of cases, the standard test that will be offered at an HIV testing 
center will be an HIV antibody Test. The HIV antibody Test detects 
antibodies to the virus in your blood. For most of the people these 
antibodies take 6 weeks to 3 months to develop, sometimes, in very rare 
cases, may take up to 6 months. Since you've tested negative after 5 months of the contact, we can presume 
that you do not have HIV. Symptoms of HIV infection are fever, headache, 
tiredness, and swollen nodes in the neck. These symptoms usually disappear 
within a few weeks. I would suggest that you consult your doctor for your 
symptoms of tiredness and yellowish discoloration of tongue. Take care.
