Thank you for your question. It is possible that you have sustained a skin 
infection from being pricked by the sago palm. These minor injuries could 
have inoculated bacteria beneath the surface of the skin and as a result 
causing a skin infection. In order that you treat this infection you will 
need to have this infection examined by a doctor and you will likely be 
prescribed a topical corticosteroid along with antibiotics to clear the 
bacteria causing the infection. Please seek medical attention.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
