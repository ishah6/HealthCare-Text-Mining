Gamma-Hydroxybutyric acid(GHB) is a central nervous system depressant. 
Euphoria, increased sex drive, and tranquility are reported positive 
effects of GHB abuse. Negative effects may include sweating, loss of 
consciousness, nausea, hallucinations, amnesia, and coma, among other 
adverse effects. GHB can lead to visual distortion and may be the cause of 
your problem. I would suggest that you see your doctor for a physical 
examination. Currently the only treatment available for GHB toxicity is 
supportive.
