Pregnancy is diagnosed by detecting the presence of a hormone, HCG, which 
is produced in pregnancy. Home pregnancy tests are highly accurate if used 
correctly and at the right time. The test is best done after 1 week of a 
missed period. If you are concerned about pregnancy, I suggest you visit 
your doctor for a simple blood test which is more accurate that a home 
pregnancy test.
