Thank you for your question. The only serious problem that can be caused by 
this is injury to your incision. However, there are no contraindications 
between masturbation and post inguinal hernia repair. It is recommended 
that you refrain sexual activity with your partner for about 3 -6 weeks 
until your incision is fully healed.
