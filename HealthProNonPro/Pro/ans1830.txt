Your stomach ache could be unrelated to taking pro-biotics. In-fact 
probiotics relieve stomach pain caused by lactose intolerance, helicobacter 
pylori infection and irritable bowel syndrome. If you are still 
experiencing pain, I would suggest that you consult your doctor for further 
evaluation.
