It is difficult to say what is causing your breast pain. Since a mammogram 
and ultrasound are normal, we can possibly rule out abscess and tumors as 
the cause of pain. It may also be that the pain is pain referred (as you've 
said that it starts from the armpit). Any infection, folliculitis of 
enlarged axillary lymph node may also cause similar symptoms and needs to 
be examined by your doctor.
