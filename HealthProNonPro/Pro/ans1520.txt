The use of seizure medication is associated with greater risk of fetal 
malformations in pregnancy. You may need to consult your doctor for 
management of seizure in pregnancy. Your doctor may attempt to alter the 
dosage of the drug, taper dosages to the lowest possible dose, attempt to 
withdraw the drug is there has been no seizures for 2-5 years, supplement 
diet with folic acid and provide genetic counselling.In the end there is no agreement about the anatomical effects of 
anti-epileptic drugs on the unborn child, but a doctor will try to reduce 
the risk even further.
