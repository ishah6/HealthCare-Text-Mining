I do understand your concern for the symptoms you are experiencing. Ear 
infections should not be taken lightly as they may worsen and may even 
cause a brain infection. You require a thorough evaluation by an ENT 
surgeon. He/She will take a medical history as well as perform a detailed 
examination and order the appropriate tests to diagnose the underlying 
issue causing your ear pain and tinnitus.
