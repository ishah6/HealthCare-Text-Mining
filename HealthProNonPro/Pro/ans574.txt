I would advise you to repeat the pregnancy test and maybe even get a blood 
test for to be sure of pregnancy. However, if pregnancy is rule out, stress 
is another cause of irregular or delayed periods and they often become 
regular again on there own. If your periods are still not regular, I would 
advise you to consult your doctor for further examination and tests.
