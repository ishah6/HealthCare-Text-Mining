Memory problem usually occurs because of the lack of blood going to the brain. For most people, the cause of this is poor blood circulation, either from aging, lack of excercise, or clogging or hardening of blood vessels. To improve memory, therefore, requires increases in blood circulation. 

In Chinese medicine, there are many supplements that can improve your memory. One of the most well known supplement is Ginko Biloba. It has reached mainstream and you can find them in Centrum multivitamins or in forms of supplement at most drug stores. Another less well known supplement is Fo-Ti(also known as He Shou Wu). It is harder to find. Youll need to get it in Chinese herb shops.
