Hand foot and mouth disease is caused by coxsackie virus. The symptoms 
include fever, painful oral lesions, body rash with sores and diarrhea. 
Adults are usually immune to the virus. There's no specific treatment for 
hand-foot-and-mouth disease. The disease usually clear up in seven to 10 
days. I would suggest that you watch for your symptoms and if you develop 
oral sores, you will need to see your doctor.
