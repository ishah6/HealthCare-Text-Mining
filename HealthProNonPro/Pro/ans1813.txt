Your father has several factors that might be producing these symptoms, 
generally patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPD, 
emphysema) complain of tiredness, shortness of breath, and also you stated 
that he also has high blood pressure, that’s another factor. The other 
possibility is that he is not having enough physical activity and possibly 
is overweight. He should discuss with his doctor how to practice a low 
impact physical routine according to his condition, control weight, if this 
is a problem. Yes, thyroid problems may cause tiredness and muscle and 
joint pains, but this has to be ruled out with lab tests.
