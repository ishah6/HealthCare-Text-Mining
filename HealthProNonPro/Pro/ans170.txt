Bursitis is inflammation of a bursa caused by repetitive use, trauma, 
infection, or systemic inflammatory disease. Bursae are flattened sacs that 
serve as a protective buffer between bones and overlapping muscles (deep 
bursae) or between bones and tendons/skin (superficial bursae). These 
synovial-lined sacs are filled with minimal amounts of fluid to facilitate 
movement during muscle contraction. Superficial bursae, such as the 
olecranon(elbow) and prepatellar bursae(knee), are located in the 
subcutaneous tissue. Symptoms of bursitis may include localized tenderness, 
swelling, redness, and/or reduced /limited movement. The suggested strategy 
in the case that you can actively move the elbow and you have no 
significant swelling or deformity would be: you must apply ice to the elbow 
4 to 6 times during this first 24 hours for periods no more than 15 minutes 
each time to avoid more swelling, and also ease the pain, if you have any; 
also taking Advil every 8 hours for the first 3 days and then 1 or 2 times 
a day as needed. After the first 24 hours from the fall, you will start 
applying on your elbow warm and wet compresses for periods of no more than 
15 minutes each time, 2-3 times a day, also you can do series of active 
movements of flexion and extension of the elbow.
