Thank you for your question. It is possible that you contracted a sexually 
transmitted infection such as gonorrhea or chlamydia. Given the fact that 
your partner was ill at the time of sexual intercourse leads us to believe 
you contracted this illness form her. We recommend that you promptly get 
examined by a doctor, conduct a urine test, and have the urethral meatus 
swabbed and sent to a laboratory for culturing. This will assist the doctor 
in determining which STI you have become infected with. In the meantime you 
will be treated with antibiotics which should clear this infection without 
complication. Please be guided accordingly.
