Smoking may not cause an ear infection in an adult but a child will 
definitely be affected by the second-hand smoke. There is an eightfold 
increase in cases of ear infection in children exposed to second hand 
smoke. I would suggest that you do not smoke in the house if there are 
children. Take care.
