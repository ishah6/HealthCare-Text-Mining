Thank you for your question. It is possible that these hard lumps that you 
are able to palpate on the penis could be the development of a fibrous mass 
of connective tissue (scar tissue) which is occurs right before the 
development of peyronie's disease. Due to traumatic damage, advanced age, 
or connective tissue disorders this can occur. As peyronie's disease 
worsens, it can actually cause a curvature of the penis which can be 
painful and make sexually intercourse impossible.
