Thank you for our question. The collection of fluid beneath the scalp could 
be due to swelling of lymphatic vessels and nodes in times of minor or 
major scalp infections. Since you have a high concentration of hair 
follicles (which are highly proliferation and dividing cellular 
structures), there is a lot of cellular debris which accumulates which can 
be a nidus for infection. This would result in transient swelling of the 
lymph nodes under the scalp as they assist in removing any such infection 
buy supplying immune cells. We recommend that you monitor this and if you 
experience and pain or hairloss in the are when this occurs, please see 
your doctor for further evaluation.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
