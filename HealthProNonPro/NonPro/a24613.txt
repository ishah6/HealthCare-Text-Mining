Being honest and forthright with your parents is most likely the best option you have.  It wasnt until my parents became grandparents did they realize that smoking around children was foolish.  

Despite what some may say there are clinical studies proving second hand smoke harms non smokers such as :  

Otsuka, R., Watanabe, H., Hirata, K., Tokai, K., Muro, T., & Yoshiyama, M., et al. (2001). Acute effects of passive smoking on the coronary circulation in healthy young adults. Journal American Medical Association, 286,463-441.

Li, J.S., Peat, J.K., Xuan, W., & Berry, G.
(1999). Meta-analysis on the association between environmental tobacco smoke (ETS) exposure and the
prevalence of lower respiratory tract infection in early childhood. Pediatric Pulmonology, 27(1), 5-13.

Good luck.
