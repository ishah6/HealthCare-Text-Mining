I would not recommend taking diet pill if you are breastfeeding your baby. 
Diet supplements may pose an added risk if you're breastfeeding. The 
ingredients in these products may pass into your breast milk, and we don't 
know whether they're safe for babies to consume. However if you are 
exclusively bottle feeding your baby then it is safe to take the pills.
