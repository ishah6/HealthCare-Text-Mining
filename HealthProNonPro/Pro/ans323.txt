From your symptoms, you are most probably suffering from bacterial 
vaginosis. This results from an abnormal growth of bacteria in the vagina. 
Bacterial vaginosis is not dangerous but may cause some discomfort and 
vaginal discharge with smell. The smell can sometimes be offending and 
unpleasant.Though sexual activity can cause bacterial vaginosis, vaginal douching, 
improper hygiene, recurrent antibiotics are also other factors. I would 
advise that you speak to a doctor. In addition to bacterial vaginosis, 
there is also a risk of acquiring other STDs, for which further evaluation 
is required.Treatment includes oral or vaginal metronidazole and also vaginal 
clindamycin cream. Oral metronidazole can cause some minor but unpleasant 
side effects, but is believed to be the most effective treatment.
