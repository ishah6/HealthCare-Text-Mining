According to your description, possibly you have a congenital anomaly 
called: Congenital radioulnar synostosis, in which the proximal radius and 
ulna are united, this is usually hereditary and in 60% of cases, bilateral. 
This anomaly causes difficulty holding or using small objects, inability to 
dress, wiping and feeding. If there are no functional deficits, no surgical 
correction is needed, but if the deformity leads to a functional loss of 
the movements of the forearm then there are many surgical techniques 
described for correction, called derotational osteotomies. You should have 
a consultation with an orthopedic Surgeon specialist in the area and 
discuss your surgical options.
