A number of disease conditions make you cough up blood. These include chest 
infections, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, tuberculosis, pulmonary edema, 
pulmonary hypertension and in rare cases lung cancer. If cough suppressants 
don't resolve your symptoms, you may need to consult your family doctor for 
further investigations. A complete blood count, chext x-ray, chest CT, 
bronchoscopy and sputum smear and culture may help in the diagnosis.
