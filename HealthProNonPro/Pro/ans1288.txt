Thank you for your question. You can certainly participate in contact 
sports with this condition provided you are not having a flare up of 
diverticulitis and you have been medically cleared by your doctor after a 
thorough physical exam. You should not engage in any new contact sport or 
exercise routine unless consulting your medical doctor first.
