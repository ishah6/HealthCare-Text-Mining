Most broken clavicles heal on their own, but if the fracture is 
displaced, then surgical treatment is needed. The care after the treatment 
depends on if you were operated on or you only were immobilized. You may 
need to rest and do special exercises to help heal your clavicle. It is 
very important to keep your arm from moving to allow the clavicle to heal, 
usually for about 8-10 weeks. Your doctor will review your progress and 
your X-rays periodically to let you know when to progress to the next level 
of activity meaning when you will be allowed to lifting weights.
