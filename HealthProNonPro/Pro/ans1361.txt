The interaction between specific birth control preparations and 
anti-epileptic medications should always be taken into consideration when 
figuring out what contraceptive method to use. Some anti-epilepsy medicines 
have a side-effect of increasing the speed in which some contraceptive 
pills and injections are processed by the liver. If you are taking an 
anti-epilepsy medicine that is a liver enzyme inducer, then the following 
is recommended:i) The dose of the oestrogen part needs to be at least 50 micrograms, which 
is more than the usual dose. However, it is usually preferable to use an 
alternative contraception, if possible.ii) The progestogen injection (Depo-Provera) does not interfere with liver 
enzyme-inducing drugs and is an alternative.iii) Using either barrier methods of contraception or having any type of 
coil inserted (including the intrauterine system, Mirena) are usually the 
most suitable forms of contraception to consider if you are taking a liver 
enzyme-inducing drug for your epilepsy.
