I do understand your concern. Xanax or alprazolam is used in the treatment 
of anxiety disorder, panic disorder and anxiety associated with depression. 
The drug must be used with caution because there is a high potential for 
drug dependency. Rebound or withdrawal symptoms, including seizures, may 
occur following abrupt discontinuation or large decreases in dose. I would 
suggest that you see your doctor for appropriate recommendations to taper 
off the drug.
