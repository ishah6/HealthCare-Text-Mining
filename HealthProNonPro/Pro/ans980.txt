Penis size in boys before the age of puberty may sometimes appear to be 
smaller, which may sometimes be a subjective finding. What is important in 
this case is the stretched penile length (SPL). If the SPL is less than 2.5 
standard deviations (SDs) below the mean for his age group, a diagnosis of 
microphallus or micropenis is made. During the first few years of life, the 
penis grows very little until puberty when testosterone levels begin to 
rise.
