Your procrastinating the inevitable.  I had a drinking problem for a while, one day i just stopped and got my life back on track.  Its hard to do, but drinking is not going to solve the problem.  You may have everything, but one thing you reallly dont have is happiness and thats what you are stopping to enter into your life. With drinking too you tend to not eat right.  Try reversing that and i promiise you you will start feeling better, it wont cure your feelings but it is a great start to get you on the right track.
