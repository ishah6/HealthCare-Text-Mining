no product gets rid of acne. but there are plenty of products that cause it: junk food, lotsa bread and cheese, refined sugars. remember: acne is a parasitic virus. remove its food supply (junk foods) and it will remove itself. cut the above foods from your diet, fast on water for three days every other month and eat lotsa of dandelion (no really!!). Do this for at least six months and as long as you don;t go back on the junk food diet, you should be acne free!!! yipeee!!! good luck!!
