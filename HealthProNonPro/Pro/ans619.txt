Implants have a very low failure rate, out of every 1000 women who use the 
device, fewer than two will become pregnant..However there are still 
chances of getting pregnant.Since you seem to be experiencing symptoms of 
pregnancy you may want to wait to take another pregnancy test. You can also 
do a blood test for pregnancy which is more sensitive. If you are pregnant 
however you would have to remove the implant.
