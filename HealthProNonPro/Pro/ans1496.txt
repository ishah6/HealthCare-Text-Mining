The symptoms that you described may correspond to a cervical spine nerve 
compression. In the younger patients, cervical radiculopathy may be a 
result of a disc herniation or an acute injury causing impingement of an 
exiting nerve. In the older patient, cervical radiculopathy is often a 
result of spinal canal narrowing from bone (osteophyte) formation, 
decreased disc height and degenerative changes due to aging process. The 
treatment usually includes: start a physical therapy program aimed to 
control pain and inflammation, and the use of anti-inflammatory medication 
(“motrin”, “aleve”), also you should have a re-education of habits and 
posture to improve your quality of life. You also should be independent in 
a stretching and strengthening program and continue with these exercises 
under the periodic supervision of a physical therapist initially and then 
completely on your own. If your condition fails to improve with a 
comprehensive rehabilitation program and selective injections, you may be 
considering a re-evaluation by a Orthopedic surgeon to explore other 
treatment options more aggressive.
