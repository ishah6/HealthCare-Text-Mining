Croup is a common, primarily viral respiratory tract illness in children. 
Croup usually isn't serious. Most cases of croup can be treated at home. 
Sometimes, a child will need prescription medication. Studies have shown 
that smoke, strong fumes increase and aggravate the symptoms of croup and I 
would not recommend smoking if there are children in the house.
