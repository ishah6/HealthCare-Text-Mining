It is very important that your doctor examine you to rule out any traumatic 
injury caused by the kick to your stomach. Trauma to the genitals 
especially to the vulva can cause significant bleeding due to the increased 
vessels in the area. The extent of injury can be determined by inspecting 
the genital area. Once the bleeding has been located and stopped sitz baths 
or ice packs are all that is necessary. You will definitely need to confide 
with you parents in this matter. There is no need to feel ashamed or 
worried, as this is a common occurrence and can happen to anyone. I hope 
this helps, take care.
