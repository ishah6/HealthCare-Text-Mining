There is a possibility that your symptoms are caused due to pelvic 
inflammatory disease (PID). What is PID? This is an infection of the female 
reproductive organs usually caused after an STD that was not treated 
accordingly. Lower abdominal pain is the cardinal presenting symptom in 
women with PID. The recent onset of pain that worsens during coitus or with 
jarring movement may be the only presenting symptom of PID; the onset of 
pain during or shortly after menses is particularly suggestive.I would suggest that you consult your doctor/gynecologist for further 
evaluation. The diagnosis of PID is usually done by clinical examination 
and history, though in certain cases laparoscopy may also be done to 
determine the presence of PID. Antibiotics are need for treatment of PID 
and over the counter analgesics would help alleviate the pain. I wish you a 
prompt recovery, take care.
