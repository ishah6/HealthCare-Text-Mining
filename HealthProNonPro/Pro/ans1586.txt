There is no standard timing for taking oral medication. I would advise that 
your husband take the medication whichever time he feels is convenient. If 
he prefers to take the Novo-Levofloxacin in the morning, he may go ahead 
with it, provided he takes the next dose at the same time and complete the 
full course of seven days.
