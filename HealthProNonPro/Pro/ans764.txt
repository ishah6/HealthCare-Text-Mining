It is possible that your miss periods could be due to your weight-loss. 
Amenorrhea is one of the features of anorexia nervosa and is caused by a 
hormonal imbalance. I would recommend that you see your doctor to determine 
the cause of missed periods and rule out other underlying problems that 
could cause a missed period. Your doctor may advise an complete blood 
count, hormonal studies and a pelvic ultrasound to determine the problem. I 
wish you well, take care.
