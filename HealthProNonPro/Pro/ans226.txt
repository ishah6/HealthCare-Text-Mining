Depo-Provera can change a woman's periods when she starts receiving shots, 
though this should only last till the time the shots are given. There are 
other causes of menstrual irregularities, and you should have a pelvic 
exam, pelvic ultrasound, thyroid and hormonal studies to rule out 
possibilities of polycystic ovarian syndrome, imbalance of hormones due to 
stress and thyroid issues.
