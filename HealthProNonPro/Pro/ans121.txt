Atopic dermatitis or eczema is a chronic inflammatory skin condition that 
appears to involve a genetic defect in the proteins supporting the 
epidermal barrier. Although the first episode of atopic eczema can be 
delayed to adulthood, the majority of people have a history that goes back 
to their childhood. The main symptom, as with all types of eczema, is itch. 
Generally the skin is dry but the most affected skin looks red, with a 
slightly raised but ill-defined margin when the eczema is active. The 
diagnosis of atopic eczema is usually quite straightforward on the basis of 
the symptoms, appearance and positive family history of atopy. Although 
blood tests will be likely to show generally raised levels of the IgE 
antibody this is not in itself either necessary or helpful to the doctor. 
Treatment include avoiding the irritants, using adequate moisturizers, 
treating any underlying infection and steroid creams to reduce inflammation.
