Your description corresponds most likely with a cervical nerve compression 
but it would be also important to rule out inflammation of the peripheral 
nerves at the level of the arm and hand. You have a previous history of 
cervical spine surgery almost three years ago, it is not uncommon that scar 
tissue grows in the site and along with degenerative bone changes might be 
causing nerve compression symptoms. The treatment strategy usually 
includes: physical therapy program aimed to reduce pain and inflammation, 
and the use of anti-inflammatory medication (“Motrin”, “Aleve”), also a 
re-education of your habits and posture to improve quality of life. You 
should be independent in a stretching and strengthening program and 
continue with these exercises under the periodic supervision of a physical 
therapist initially and then completely on your own. If your condition 
fails to improve with a comprehensive rehabilitation program and selective 
injections you should discuss with your doctor if you are candidate for a 
re intervention to decompress the nerves affected.
