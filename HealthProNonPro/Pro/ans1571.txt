There is a possibility of dysfunctional uterine bleeding occurring after 
tubal ligation. The proposed theory is that there is a decreased estrogen 
level due an localised increase in pressure of the ovaries after tubal 
ligation. In my opinion, I do see a benefit of taking an oral contraceptive 
pill to decrease the pain and control the bleeding. You may need to talk to 
your doctor in this regard. Take care.
