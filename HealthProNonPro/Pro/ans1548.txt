There are many possible reasons for presence of blood in cough. This could 
be due to respiratory tract infections, pneumonia, bronchitis, 
tuberculosis. Less common causes are lung cancer, bronchiectasis, foreign 
body and cardiac causes including congestive cardiac failure and mitral 
stenosis.This warrants investigation no matter what your age group, especially if 
there is a previous history of smoking. I advise attending your family 
doctor for a detailed history and clinical examination to confirm a 
diagnosis in your case. Your doctor may order a chest x-ray, sputum 
microscopy and culture to help determine the cause of your symptoms.
