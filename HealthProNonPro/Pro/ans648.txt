Increased pressure in your eye could indicate that you are at a risk for 
developing glaucoma. It is very important for you to get your eyes examined 
by an ophthalmologist to rule out damage to the optic nerve caused by 
increased pressure in the eye. Glaucoma can be treated with medication and 
laser surgery.
