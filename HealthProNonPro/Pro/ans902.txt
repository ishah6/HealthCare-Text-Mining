Most likely you have a liquid collection in your prepatellar bursa 
produced by the previous traumatism (sprain). The prepatellar bursa is a 
superficial bursa with a thin synovial lining located between the skin and 
the patella. Normally, it does not communicate with the joint space and 
contains a minimal amount of fluid; however, inflammation of the 
prepatellar bursa results in marked increase of fluid within its space, 
like a “golf ball”. Apparently you had an uncomplicated knee injury that 
with conservative treatment has a great chance to improve, anyways if you 
notice one or more of the following symptoms: more inflammation, remarkable 
limitation on flexion-extension movements, locking of the knee, or 
instability, the next step would be an evaluation by an Orthopedic Surgeon. 
But if this is not the case, the suggested strategy would be: protection 
(avoid activities or movements that may produce pain, especially kneeling), 
local ice packs for periods no more than 15 minutes each time, and after, 
local hot compresses, you could use anti-inflammatory medication (i.e.: 
“Aleve”, “Advil”). The healing time is different for each patient but 
generally there is a progressive improvement during the next 4-6 weeks 
after the injury.
