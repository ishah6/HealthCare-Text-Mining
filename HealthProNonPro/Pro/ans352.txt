HCG concentrations should drop rapidly following a miscarriage and should 
be undetectable within 2-3 weeks. If hCG does not fall to undetectable 
levels, it may indicate remaining hCG-producing tissue that will need to be 
removed. You may need to see your doctor to see whether it is a new 
pregnancy or a retained products of conception that is causing the positive 
HCG.
