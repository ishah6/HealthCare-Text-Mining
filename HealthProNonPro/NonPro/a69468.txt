Do you *really* think you can cheat on your girlfriend accidentally?

And if six girls have dumped you for cheating, how can you believe it was all their fault?

The terms "girlfriend" and "boyfriend" suggest some kind of committed and exclusive relationship.

Maybe you arent ready for a girlfriend yet. As they used to say, you might be better off "playing the field" until youre ready to make a commitment to one person. That way you wont be raising some poor girls expectations, then disappointing her because you cheated.
