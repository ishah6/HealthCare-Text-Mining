Flucillin (Flucloxacillin) is a penicillin antibiotic used for the 
treatment of used for the treatment of pneumonia, skin and bone infection. 
Since both alcohol and antibiotics are broken down in the liver, too much 
of both can cause a system overload. The effects of combining antibiotics 
and alcohol can vary, depending on the specific antibiotic. Though alcohol 
may not diminish the effectiveness of the drug, combining flucillin and 
alcohol may increase the side-effects such as stomach upset, dizziness and 
drowsiness.Alcohol will reduce your energy levels and increase the recovery time, thus 
I would not recommend consuming alcohol when on an antibiotic.
