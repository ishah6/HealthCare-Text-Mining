Eat wheat bread instead of white. Eat carrots instead of chips. Eat grapefruit or apples to snack instead of sweets. Dont have seconds. Drink only water. No fast food or eating outside your house unless you know its healthy. Dinner should contain meat and veggies. Lay off the sauces. I cannot promise 43 pounds in 4 weeks, but so far Ive lost 28 pounds in 4 months without excercise. Im sure excercise would increase the weight loss, but its not an option for me right now (3 kids, hubby in Iraq) and I refuse to buy weight equipment. Sometimes Ill walk in front of my tv while I watch it, but that is about as excercisey as I get right now. Just changing your diet and watching your food intake can do wonders for your weight loss goals.
