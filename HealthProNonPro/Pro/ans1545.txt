There are many conditions which cause vertigo. Most common causes are 
Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) and Meniere's Disease. In BPPV, 
vertigo occurs when patients change the position of their heads, for 
example, going from a sitting to lying position or vice versa. BPPV usually 
resolves on its own. There are usually no abnormalities found on physical 
examination. In Meniere's disease, there is associated ringing in the ears, 
severe nausea, vomiting and hearing loss. I suggest seeing an 
ENT specialist to determine if any of these conditions are responsible for 
your problem.
