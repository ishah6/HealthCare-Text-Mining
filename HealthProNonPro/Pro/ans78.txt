Adhesions are strands of scar tissue that form in response to abdominal 
surgery. Symptoms caused by abdominal adhesions may vary from mild cramp 
like pain to intestinal obstruction. The pain you are experiencing could 
certainly be cause by pelvic adhesions after hysterectomy but it is 
required that your doctor first rule out other causes of abdominal pain.
