Diverticulitis is the inflammation of small mucosal herniations protruding 
through the intestinal layers and the smooth muscle. The approach to the 
treatment of diverticulitis can be broadly classified into either 
uncomplicated disease or complicated disease. Sever cases will require 
hospitalization and IV antibiotics.Uncomplicated cases may need oral antibiotic, a combination of 
ciprofloxacin (or trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole) and metronidazole. 
Initially diet must consist of only clear fluids and solids can be added 
after clinical improvement as tolerated.
