Rifampin (R-cinex) is taken on an empty stomach, 1-2 hours before food 
because food consumption hampers the absorption of the drug from the 
intestines. If you forget to take a dose, take it as soon as you remember 
it, you do not need to restart the medication or take a double dose. 
Consult your doctor if you've missed more that one dose. It is important 
not to miss a dose because this make the bacteria resistant to the drug.
