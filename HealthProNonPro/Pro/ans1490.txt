The symptoms of sore throat and swollen lymphnodes may be due to a flu, 
though HIV may also present with similar symptoms. The HIV antibody Test 
detects antibodies to the virus in your blood. For most of the people these 
antibodies take 6 weeks to 3 months to develop, sometimes, in very rare 
cases, may take up to 6 months. For this reason, getting tested before 3 
months have passed may result in an unclear test result, as the infected 
person may not yet have developed antibodies to HIV. These 3 – 6 months are 
known as the 'window period'. I recommend you to wait for at least 3 months 
after the last sexual act before getting tested for HIV.
