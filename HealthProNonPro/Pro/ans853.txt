Medication should not be your primary method for weight loss. You will be 
able to achieve better and faster results with proper lifestyle 
modifications. I would advise you to reduce your calorie intake and 
exercise 3-4 times a week. Avoid all deep fried foods, eat small frequent 
meals and get proper sleep. It may be also be advisable to see your doctor 
before starting any medications and exercise. I hope the information helps.
