A frequent question I get asked by couples having hepatitis c is the risk 
of infecting the baby if they try to get pregnant. The risk of infection 
varies and depends on which partner has the infection. If the mother has 
hepatitis C, there is a 1 in 25 chance that the baby will get the 
infection. However if the father has the infection and the mother does not, 
there is no risk to the baby. The chance of the virus being transmitted 
both from father to mother and then from mother to baby is almost zero. I 
wish you well, take care.I would suggest that you consult you health care provider for further 
evaluation. My advice would be for your partner to get evaluated for 
hepatitis C and take treatment. It is important to note that the drug used 
to treat hepatitis C, Ribavarin, has been known to cause birth defects. 
This defect is seen when either partner is taking the drug. During the 
treatment couples must use two effective forms of birth control to avoid a 
pregnancy, eg condoms in male and birth pills in women.
