Every other George Ive known and Ive known many has been very sporty.   The only "sport"you seem to practice is fighting.  Unless youre a professional fighter, Id say stop fighting and start running.  Every other George Ive known has been very kind and friendly, so if you are a proffesional fighter you might want to retire, fighting doesnt suit you.  Ive only ever known one George who ever got drunk and like you, he didnt seem to always be happy.  Alcohol is a depressant so unless your happy you shouldnt be drinking.
PS
My dad was a "George" as were two of my moms siblings George and Georgette.  My aunts son has that name as does his neice.  Dads cousin married one.Coworker, best friend, friends dad...
Your not living up to your name.  Again, quit drinking and fighting, and start running.
