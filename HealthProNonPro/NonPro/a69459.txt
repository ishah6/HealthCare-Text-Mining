Much as I dislike saying this, pal, but YOU have some serious issues!  6 times?  An accident you say... did you think it was her?  Women who cry b/c of a movie is in NO WAY the same as your "vulnerable" state of mind.  Get help - or just grow up and accept the fact youre a player and these women are very, very temporary.  Im sure thats how they see it.  I say: Screw the world while you still can!!  lmao!!
