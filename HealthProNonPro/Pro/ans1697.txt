Very difficult indeed your mother’s situation in the view of the multiple 
health issues present at the same time. The scoliosis and the damage 
produced for the previous nerve compression are causing the Chronic low 
back pain (CLBP) , which is considered the most expensive condition in 
industrialized countries and the most common cause of activity limitation 
in persons younger than 45 years. It is defined as pain that persists 
longer than 12 weeks and is often attributed to degenerative or traumatic 
conditions of the spine. Your mother case may be managed as chronic low 
back pain (CLBP), she tried already Physical Therapy and acupuncture, you 
do not said if she is taking anti-inflammatory medication (“Aleve”, 
“Motrin”). Some antidepressants are useful in chronic LBP to alleviate 
insomnia, and pain. In addition, these medications may improve the 
patient's ability to cope, and they may reduce depression, anxiety, or 
fatigue associated with chronic LBP. Local anesthetics, corticosteroids, or 
other substances may be directly injected into painful soft tissues, facet 
joints, nerve roots, or epidural spaces. I suggest an evaluation by a 
specialist in pain management to explore other treatment possibilities for 
your mother.
