Thank you for your question. First, it is important that you are diagnosed 
with parasitic worms in the intestine by a doctor before taking this 
prescription Anti-parasitic medication. Do not take it without being under 
the direct guidance of your doctor. At 23 if you have not undergone 
puberty, we recommend that you follow up with an endocrinologist to 
determine the cause of this. Possible causes of delayed puberty in males 
could be due to deficiencies in male sex hormones, chronic diseases, or 
even genetic mutations that were present at birth. You will need to be 
carefully followed by an endocrinologist to determine the cause of your 
delayed puberty.Thank you fro consulting AskTheDoctor.com
