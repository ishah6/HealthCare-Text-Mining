The hymen has different normal variants varying from the common annular 
shape, to cresenteric and navicular forms. Hymenal variations are rarely 
clinically significant, but sometimes may result in retention of vaginal 
secretions and prolongation of the common condition of a mixed bacterial 
vulvovaginitis.Your bleeding could be due to an injury or variation in the hymen 
structure. I would advise that you see your doctor for an examination. A 
pelvic examination, ultrasound or MRI may help to diagnose the problem.
