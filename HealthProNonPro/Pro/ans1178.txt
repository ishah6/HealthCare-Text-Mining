Thank you for your question. It is possible that you are experiencing a 
condition known as actinic keratosis. This is a condition in which the 
ultraviolet rays of the sun cause damage to the skin of the scalp and ears 
producing rough dry spots. This is commonly seen in older persons who are 
balding. This is a cause for concern as Actinic keratosis is associated 
with the development of a type of skin cancer called squamous cell 
carcinoma. Now, without a physical examination or picture, this explanation 
we have provided is not a definitive diagnosis by any means. We recommend 
that you consult a dermatologist to have these rough areas evaluated 
extensively.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
