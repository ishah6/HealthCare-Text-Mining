Dysplasia of the Hip (DDH), meaning looseness in the baby’s hip, this may 
lead to problems with the way the hip develops.DDH is a treatable condition 
which occurs in otherwise normal, healthy babies. Early treatment is 
important to prevent problems later in life. DDH occurs in approximately 1 
in 1,000 babies and the cause is unknown. Factors that might contribute 
include lax ligaments around the hip (especially in girls), a tight 
intrauterine space (mostly for first born babies), breech positioning prior 
to birth, or a family history of hip problems. However, nothing could have 
been done to prevent this from happening. Treatment is relatively easy and 
reliable for infants, but becomes difficult in later years and very complex 
after maturity.Treatment depends on the child’s age and the degree of 
looseness in the hip. In a newborn, for example, is treated with close 
monitoring and gentle positioning with double diapering. If the hip is out 
of place or the looseness does not tighten up within a few weeks, a soft 
positioning device called a Pavlik harness is used for 1-2 months. After 2 
years of age, the Dysplasia may become severe, making major open surgical 
intervention necessary to release tight structures and realign the hip 
bones to stabilize the hip.
