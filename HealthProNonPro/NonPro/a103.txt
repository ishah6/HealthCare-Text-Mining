Maybe because they feel put-upon by your special request. If you tell a party host youre a Vegetarian, he may feel that you expect him to provide extra food that would be suitable for you. If you tell a date youre a Vegetarian, he may feel that his choice of date restaurants is limited by your lifestyle.

Or are you in their face about your Vegetarianism?  If youre an activist, they may feel that you are judging their choice to eat meat.

Youll win people over to your way of living if you arent demanding and are flexible with your choices.
If youre invited to a dinner party, offer to bring a Vegetarian dish to share with the others.  If youre invited out to dinner, be armed with restaurant choices that can accomodate you. "Ethnic" restaurants are usually a safe bet.

Dont push your beliefs on others, but definitely share them if asked. Vegetarianism is a very personal choice, so know that your personal story will be more compelling than political statements.
