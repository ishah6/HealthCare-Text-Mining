Gynecomastia is usually secondary to the normal hormonal imbalances 
between testosterone and estrogen that commonly occurs during puberty () 
and it may affect up to 40% of adolescent boys during puberty, usually by 
the age of 14. Several research studies reveal that mild gynecomastia 
regresses entirely in all patients, while moderate in only 20% after a 3 
year duration. In contrast, severe gynecomastia which usually persists 
requires cosmetic surgery in a large proportion of patients (40%). This 
condition usually is benign and your Pediatrician should reassure you that 
this is normal and in most cases should disappear within a few months or 
years without treatment. This is particularly true in your case because you 
already got hormonal levels results within normal limits. As long as you 
keep a good training, healthy diet and away from the anabolic steroids or 
hormonal enhancers you will be ok.
