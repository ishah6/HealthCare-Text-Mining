It seems that previously you had an intercostal neuritis that went away, 
then you are having fatigue, dizziness, nausea, balance problems, possibly 
you should be checked for anemia and Vitamin B12 deficiency. Vitamin B12 
deficiency can have a number of possible causes. Typically it occurs in 
people whose digestive systems do not adequately absorb the vitamin from 
the foods they eat, excessive alcohol consumption, long term use of 
acid-reducing medications, atrophic gastritis, conditions that affect the 
small intestine, vegetarians. A deficiency of vitamin B12 can lead to 
vitamin B12 deficiency anemia. A mild deficiency may cause only mild, if 
any, symptoms, similar to those that you described, but as the anemia 
worsens it may causes symptoms such as: rapid heart beating, pale skin, 
stomach upset, weight loss, sore tongue, weakness, tiredness, light-headed, 
diarrhea or constipation and nerve problems. For some people, B12 
supplementation may be necessary for life. If a diet lacking in animal 
products is the cause, the doctor will recommend dietary changes along with 
supplementation of vitamin B12 by injection or tablet. For most people, 
treatment resolves the anemia; however, any nerve damage that has occurred 
as a result of the deficiency could be permanent. I suggest that you talk 
to your doctor about get some blood test done to rule out anemia and also 
check Vitamin B12 levels.
