The most probable cause of your symptoms may be due to eustachian tube 
dysfunction. The eustachian tube connects the inner ear to the back of the 
throat and if this gets blocked, pressure develops inside the ear cavity 
leading to the symptoms of ear discomfort. Treatment involves medications 
such as decongestants, systemic or local antihistamines and nasal topical 
steroids. Severe symptoms due to eustachian tube dysfunction may have a 
ventilation tube placed in their ear drum.
