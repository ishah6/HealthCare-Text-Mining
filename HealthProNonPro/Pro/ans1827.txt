Your red eyes may be caused by allergic conjunctivitis. It is caused by 
inflammation of conjunctiva due to a reaction from allergy-causing 
substances such as pollen or dust. Symptoms may be seasonal and can 
include: redness of the eyes, intense itching or burning, puffy eyelids, 
discharge from the eyes.You may need to see an ophthalmologist for further evaluation. Diagnosis of 
allergic conjunctivitis generally is made by taking a thorough history and 
by careful clinical observation. Your doctor may look for eosinophils in 
the blood or scrapings from the conjunctiva, evidence of small bumps on the 
inside of the eyes called papillary conjunctivitis and positive skin test 
for allergens.Treatment involves avoiding exposure to the allergen, antihistamine or 
anti-inflammatory drops and mild eye steroid preparations.
