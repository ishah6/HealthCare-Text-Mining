I do understand your concern. Reversal of tubal sterilization can be 
performed through surgery or in-vitro fertilization. The success of 
reversal tubal sterilization surgery depends on the skill of the surgeon 
but a high failure risk. IVF can also be an option but is much more costly 
as compared to surgery. You may need to consult with a fertility specialist 
doctor or a surgeon who deals with restorative surgeries.
