Thats a difficult question to answer without knowing what your daily activity level is.  When I was a very active bicyclist, sugars were very important, and different types of sugars are important, so, back then it was extremely important to stay loaded with carbohydrates.  Now, in my older years and not doing such intense athletic activities, too much sugar can have bad effects on my ability to sleep, and on my mood, so I have to cut way back on my sugars.  Check your doctor for information in this area because he or she knows a whole lot more about your vital signs and medical history, etc., and can give a whole lot more intelligent answer than anybody here.  I was always after the best information in my bicycling days since I was SOOOOOOO much into very big bicycling in distance and speed.  You care for yourself the same way.  God Bless you.
