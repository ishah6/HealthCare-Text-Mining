Dear Ravi:The data that you provided is limited to jump to a definite 
diagnosis. I am going to give you some facts about the bone tumors. There 
are many different types of bone cancer,the most common primary bone tumors 
include osteosarcoma, Ewing's sarcoma, chondrosarcoma, malignant fibrous 
histiocytoma, fibrosarcoma, and chordoma. The most common symptom of bone 
tumors is pain. In most cases, the symptoms become gradually more severe 
with time, including bone pain. Initially, the pain may only be present 
either at night or with activity. Depending on the growth of the tumor, 
those affected may have symptoms for weeks, months, or years. In some 
cases, a mass or lump may be felt either on the bone or in the tissues 
surrounding the bone. This is most common with fibrosarcoma but can occur 
with other bone tumors. The bones can become weakened by the tumor and lead 
to a fracture after little or no trauma or just from standing on the 
affected bone. This can occur with both benign and malignant tumors. Even 
benign tumors can spread locally and weaken the surrounding bone.
