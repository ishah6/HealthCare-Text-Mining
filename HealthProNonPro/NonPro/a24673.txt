wow. theres no easy way. just wait for the right time when you feel like you can do it. and just be honest with them. at times like this you really need all the love and support from your friends and family. but dont worry, now the medicine is getting better and better and a lot of people get cured. i wish you the best of luck. stay strong and optimistic. i trully believe that if you believe you will get better, you really will.
