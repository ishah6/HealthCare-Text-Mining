I can understand your anxiety. The reasons for your delayed period could be 
due to stress, changing schedules, hormonal imbalance, vigorous exercise. 
Stress is a leading cause of irregular periods and they often become 
regular again on there own. If your periods are not regular after a period 
of observation, I would recommend consulting your doctor for further 
evaluation.
