Numbness. That is what I call this state. Its where your emotions have taken over your physical body immobilizing any surface reactions (body language)and freezing your state of mind, creating complete and total numbness. A physial feeling comparable to that of freshly poored concrete solidifying into a block of cement. So heavy that moving, doing,being,feeling or anything for that matter isnt possible.Youre not able to move,not able to scream, unable to describe. Just numb.
