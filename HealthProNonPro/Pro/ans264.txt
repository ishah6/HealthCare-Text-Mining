Emergency contraceptive pills or "Morning after pill" are safe and have no 
long term side effects. Though some women may experience unexpected or more 
than usual bleeding. This bleeding should clear up by the next period. Also 
some women may experience that their periods are earlier or later than 
usual. If the bleeding continues into the next period, I would suggest that 
your girlfriend see her doctor for further evaluation.
