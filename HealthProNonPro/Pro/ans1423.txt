The numbness in your shoulder to your fingertips as you described it might 
be due to a cervical nerve compression (C7-C8), but it would be important 
to rule out inflammation of the peripheral nerves at the level of the arm 
and hand, meaning a Carpal tunnel Syndrome. In the younger patients, 
cervical radiculopathy may be a result of a disc herniation or an acute 
injury causing impingement of an exiting nerve. In the older patient, 
cervical radiculopathy is often a result of spinal canal narrowing from 
bone (osteophyte) formation, decreased disc height and degenerative changes 
due to aging process. The treatment strategy usually includes: a physical 
therapy program aimed to reduce pain and inflammation, and the use of 
anti-inflammatory drugs (“Motrin”, “Aleve”), also a re-education of habits 
and posture to improve quality of life. You should be independent in a 
stretching and strengthening program and continue with these exercises 
under the periodic supervision of a physical therapist initially and then 
completely on your own. If the condition fails to improve with a 
comprehensive rehabilitation program and selective injections, if required, 
then you should be presented with a surgical evaluation. Often, patients 
should show progressive improvement over the first 6-8 weeks with 
conservative treatment. If there is no significant improvement in this time 
frame, consider a re-evaluation.
