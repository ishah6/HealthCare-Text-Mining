Thyroid surgery may injure the recurrent laryngeal nerve and or superior 
laryngeal nerve. Injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve causes vocal cord 
paralysis and will present as vocal changes, dysphagia and aspiration. 
There are two surgical treatment options available for patients with 
unilateral vocal-fold paralysis: medialization and reinnervation. 
Medialization is most commonly performed. I would suggest that you consult 
a surgeon who specializes in reconstructive surgeries of the thyroid.
