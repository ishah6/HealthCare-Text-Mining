Thank you for your question. The conversion of platelet rich plasma to 
platelet rich fibrin matrix is a highly precise and complex laboratory 
procedure that is performed under sterile conditions. There are some kits 
available on the market, which trained physicians can utilize in office in 
preparation of PRFM. This is an easy and convenient way at preparing PRFM 
prior to injection.
