There is certainly a chance that you may become pregnant but it is less 
likely. The only way to be certain of pregnancy is through a urine 
pregnancy test done two weeks after the act or in case your missed your 
periods. The test is best done in the morning. I would suggest that you use 
contraceptive measures like ocps or condoms if you do not wish to become 
pregnant. Take care.
