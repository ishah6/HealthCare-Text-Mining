Irregular and more than usual bleeding during periods is sometimes seen 
after depo injections. It may take upto a year for your the spotting to 
stop. Spotting after intercourse is never normal and could be due to 
infections, cervical dysplasia, polyps, endometriosis and fibroids. I would 
advise that you watch your symptoms, it could be that the spotting is an 
incidental incident. If however you continue to experience regular 
spotting, I would advise that you follow up with your doctor.
