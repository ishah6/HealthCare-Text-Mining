Your symptoms are indicative of a breast abscess. A breast abscess is a 
localized collection of pus in the breast tissue which may develop as a 
complication of mastitis. Most breast abscesses are caused by 
Staphylococcus aureus. The primary management of breast abscess is 
drainage, along with antibiotic therapy appropriate for the underlying 
cause of the abscess. However, if a patient with a breast infection does 
not respond to treatment, inflammatory breast cancer should be suspected. 
In inflammatory breast cancer the skin examination will demonstrate 
thickening, erythema, peau d'orange (orange peel like appearance of breast 
skin) and there is often associated axillary lymphadenopathy. Magnetic 
resonance imaging (MRI) may also be of value if inflammatory breast cancer 
is suspected.
