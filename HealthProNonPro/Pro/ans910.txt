Most ovarian cysts are functional cysts. Ovaries contain follicles that 
produce the hormones estrogen and progesterone and release an egg during 
ovulation. Sometimes these follicles keep on growing and forms cysts. There 
are two types of functional cysts, follocular and corpus luteum cyst. 
Treatment of a fuctional cyst depends on your age, the type and size of 
your cyst, and your symptoms. Your doctor may suggest watchful waiting, 
birth control pills or surgery. I wish you well, take care.
