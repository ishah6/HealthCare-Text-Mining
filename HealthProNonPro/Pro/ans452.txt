I do understand your concern for your best friend health. It is difficult 
for me to say what the lesion is. It could either be an fungal infection or 
psoriasis is another possibility. In the end, it would be advisable that 
your friend see a dermatologist for examination and testing for the scalp 
lesion. I wish your friend well, take care.
