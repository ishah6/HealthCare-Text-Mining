Moles or nevi are common skin lesions caused by the proliferation of 
pigment cells in the skin called melanocytes. Moles are usually benign in 
nature, however in my opinion it would be good practice to get it examined 
by a dermatologist to rule out malignant melanoma (a cancerous form of 
nevi).A mole may be treated for cosmetic reasons and the surgical options are 
electrosurgery/shave biopsy and excision biopsy, which may in some cases 
leave a scar. I would suggest that you consult a dermatologist before going 
ahead for a tattoo.
