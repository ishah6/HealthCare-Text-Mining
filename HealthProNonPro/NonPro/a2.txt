The concept of happiness is this simple. What we are striving for lies in ourselves. It starts from us and ends at us. Happiness is essentially getting back to our true nature. We are nothing but a pure and divine speck of cosmic energy. Once we realize this, we will know the ultimate purpose of life and as Dalai Lama said, â€œThe purpose of our life is to be Happy.â€
