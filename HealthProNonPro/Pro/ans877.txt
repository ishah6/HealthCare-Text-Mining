Mobic (meloxicam) in a non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug that is used 
for pain relief. Since you're on 30 mg (exceeding the 15 mg recommended 
maximum daily dose), this may make you prone to bleeding from the stomach 
or intestines and liver/kidney failure. I would advise you to get for 
kidney and liver function tests done every 6 months or earlier to test for 
increased levels of the drug.
