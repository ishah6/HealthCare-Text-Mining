burns. in certain countries, it is also used to treat intestinal infections 
and as a laxative. Aloe gel is used as an emollient, moisturizer, and 
wound-healing agent in various pharmaceutical and cosmetic formulations.Aloe promotes wound healing. It is of therapeutic value in thermal injuries 
and a wide variety of soft tissue injuries, preventing progressive dermal 
ischemia following thermal injury, frostbite, and electrical injury. Aloe 
penetrates injured tissues, relieves pain, is anti-inflammatory, and 
dilates capillaries, thereby increasing blood flow to the injury. Aloe has 
antithromboxane activity, yet maintains prostaglandin ratio without causing 
injured blood vessels to collapse.Aloe vera should be used with caution in individuals receiving laxatives, 
digoxin and other medications used for heart rhythm disturbances, 
diuretics, or steroids due to increased risk of dehydration, potassium
