Your pain caoould be caused due to dysmenorrhea. It is defined as difficult 
menstrual flow or painful menstruation. High levels of prostaglandins which 
cause stimulation and contraction of the uterine muscles are though to be 
the cause of dysmenorrhea.Application of warm compresses to the lower abdomen and painkillers like 
ibuprofen may help to relieve the pain. If the pain is not relieved by 
these measures I would advice you to see your doctor to rule out 
endometriosis, adenomyosis, ovarian cyst, uterine polyps and adhesion which 
may present with similar signs and symptoms.
