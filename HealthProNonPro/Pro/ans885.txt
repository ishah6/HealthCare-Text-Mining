Most cases of breast tenderness is usually related to the menstrual cycle 
and occurs when the level of estrogen reaches a peak in the mid cycle and 
the progesterone levels go up during the end of the cycle. The rise of 
progesterone causes increase in the breast size and may present with pain. 
The breast tissue has a rough texture which is what you must have felt. No 
treatment is required in most cases other than over the counter pain 
medications. However if your symptoms continue to worsen or you palpate a 
lump, I would then advise you to see your doctor.
