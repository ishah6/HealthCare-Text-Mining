It all depends on how crooked your teeth are.  When you first get them your whole jaw hurts because your teeth are being moved very quickly.  Just take some painkiller.  They only hurt for the first few days. :)  Though it REALLY hurts to get them off it is definitley worth it!  I had crooked teeth a few years ago and I got braces and now I have really straight beautiful teeth!  :D
