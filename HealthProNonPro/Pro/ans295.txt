Fetal movement is a sign of fetal well-being and I do understand your 
concern. Most mothers start to experience the movement of the baby anywhere 
between 16 to 22 weeks. First-time moms may not feel these movements as 
early as second-time moms. Each woman and each pregnancy is different, so 
you may not feel movement as early as some do. I would advise that you see 
your doctor or obstetrician for an examination and an ultrasound to check 
for fetal well being.
