Lorazepam is sometimes used in the management of acute anxiety and panic 
attacks. The drug has to be used carefully due to the risk of dependence, 
withdrawal and anxiety. It should only be used for a period of 6 weeks or 
less. The usual dosage for anxiety and panic disorder is 0.25-0.5 mg 
thrice daily, not to exceed 4mg/day.
