It is difficult for a parent to see that their child is not active as other 
children of his age. The symptoms you have mentioned, bluish discoloration 
of lips, not feeding well, frequent respiratory infections and underweight 
for his age, could indicate of an underlying congenital heart disease. 
Most common cause of a congenital heart disease is a Ventricular septal 
defect (VSD) and accounts for upto 30% of all congenital heart defects. 
Generally VSD is detected shortly after birth as a heart murmur. VSDs that 
fail to be detected at birth manifests with symptoms as the one you've 
mentioned. I would suggest that you consult your child's pediatrician for 
further evaluation. Usually an echocardigram will provide the definitive 
diagnosis. A chest radiograph, ECG and MRI can also be done to check for 
and other problems. I hope this helps, take care.
