Halitosis can cause social problems and I do understand your problem. 
Usually in cases of halitosis, mouth washes and dental treatments only 
provide temporary relief. In order to treat halitosis it is important to 
treat the microbial growth and underlying digestive problems.There are hundreds of bacteria species in the mouth. They each have 
preferences to various food products and proteins and the digestion of 
these proteins lead to the fetid odor. In most cases the bad breath arises 
for the mouth itself. It may also arise for the back of the tongue, nasal 
passages, lung infections and the esophagus.The best way to treat halitosis is to maintain good oral hygiene practices. 
Dental flossing and oral mouth rinses help to decrease the bad breath. The 
best time to use a mouthwash is probably before bedtime because the residue 
of the mouthrinse may remain in the mouth for a longer period of time and 
have a greater effect. Antimicrobial compounds via mouth rinses, 
dentifrices, or lozenges can also help. Other methods to reduce halitosis 
include changes in diet, especially reducing the intake of protein in diet 
and adequate hydration.
