Upon IUD removal, residual effects on the uterus may still be present. It 
may take awhile, maybe a few months, after IUD removal before the hormonal 
effects on the uterus are reversed. Menstrual irregularities and hormonal 
effects (breast tenderness) may be observed as the body is readjusting. 
Other cause of cervical and uterine pain could be due to pelvic 
inflammatory disease, vaginitis or cystitis. I would suggest that you see 
your health-care provider for a complete physical examination, blood-work, 
urinalysis and a lower abdominal ultrasound.
