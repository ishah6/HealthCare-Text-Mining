Thank you for your question. Cutis anserina or 'goose bumps' is a raising 
of the the base of hairs on the skin which appears as bumps on the surface 
of the skin. The most common goose bumps are formed are in response to 
changes in temperature or emotional stimuli such as fear. This is an 
involuntary response which is mediated by sympathetic nervous system. 
Hormones that are involved in the regulation of the sympathetic nervous 
system include Adrenaline and in times of intense emotion or fear, 
adrenaline is released resulting in formation of goose bumps. In very rare 
cases such as yourself, one can elicit this involuntary response at will by 
the same physiological mechanisms.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
