Coughing up blood is known as hemoptysis. This may be caused by a simple 
infection of the lung, inflammatory disease of the lung, or may be due to a 
malignant growth. I advise attending your family doctor for a detailed 
history and clinical examination to confirm a diagnosis in your case. If 
you have significant bleeding, associated with dizziness or 
lightheadedness, I would advise attending your local emergency department . 
Hemoptysis warrants investigation no matter what your age group, especially 
if there is a previous history of smoking.
