In the view of the vague nature of your question and the lack of details, 
for example you do not tell your age and/or previous history, my answer 
will be very general. The most common cause of knee pain is the 
chondromalacia patella or Patello femoral syndrome, in the case that you 
have history of a traumatism in the knee, some other causes must be rule 
out, for example: ligament, meniscus, muscle or capsule lesions. As you 
see, it depends on several factors to determine the nature of the knee 
pain. If you are taking anti-inflammatory medication and the pain continues 
or even gets worse, I strongly recommend you to have an evaluation by an 
orthopedic surgeon.
