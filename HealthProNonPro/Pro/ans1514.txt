The testicles are in the scrotum because they require a cooler environment 
for proper sperm production (the temperature of the scrotum is 0.8 oC 
cooler than the body). If the testicles are exposed to hot temperatures 
such as tight underwear, jeans, hot tub baths and sedentary jobs in 
foundries and broiler plants, this can cause a lower sperm count. Prolonged 
exposure can result in permanent damage to the testicles.
