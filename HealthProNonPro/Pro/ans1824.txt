Your problem is most probably caused by phimosis, a condition in which the 
foreskin cannot be retracted over the head of the penis. It may be due to 
unusually tight skin or infection of the glans penis.The first line of treatment is by stretching of the foreskin manually or 
with balloon devices. Steroid creams applied to the area have also shown to 
help. If this does not work then the surgical circumcision may be required.
