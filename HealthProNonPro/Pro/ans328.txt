Generally the treatment of a foot fracture depends upon what bone is 
broken, the mechanism of injury, the underlying medical condition of the 
patient, and whether the fracture is open (the skin is broken) or closed 
(the skin is intact). The Shepherd fracture involves the posterior or back 
part, of the talus and is seen in athletes who dance or kick. The treatment 
is immobilization in a cast. Immobilization of the fractured foot helps to 
control pain and inflammation. Anti-inflammatory medication (“Advil”, 
“Motrin”) can be useful with pain control by decreasing inflammation in the 
area. Nondisplaced neck and body fractures are treated with a short leg 
cast or fracture brace and no weight bearing for 6 to 10 weeks and 
depending on the bone healing showed in the follow up xrays partial and 
progressive weight bearing is allowed. Posterior process (Shepherd) 
fractures treated with immobilization and partial or full weight bearing 
generally have a good outcome, with the possibility of some residual pain 
and stiffness.
