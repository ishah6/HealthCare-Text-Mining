In1956, Jim and Elisabeth Elliot were missionaries in South America. Jim and his four colleagues were killed by members of the Auca tribe of Indians as they shared the gospel of Jesus Christ with them. After his death, his wife found these words written in his journal that seem to sum up the purpose of Jim Elliotâ€™s life.

"He is no fool who gives up what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose."
