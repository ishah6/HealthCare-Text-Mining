Trauma to the testicle may present as a hematocele or a ruptured testis. I 
would advise you to consult your doctor for a thorough physical examination 
and scrotal ultrasonography or doppler studies if required. Treatment will 
depend on the extent of scrotal injury. Conservative management includes 
scrotal support, non steroidal anti-inflammatory medication, ice packs and 
bed rest. Hematocele may often require surgical exploration. I hope the 
information help you.
