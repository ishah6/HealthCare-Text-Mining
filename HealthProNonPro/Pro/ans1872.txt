Zoloft is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), an 
antidepressant used to treat depression. An important side effect of the 
drug is sexual dysfunction characterised by decreased libido, premature 
ejaculation, impotence and anorgasmia.It is important for your boyfriend to consult his doctor with regard to the 
side effects of zoloft. His doctor may want to get a complete blood count, 
semen analysis and culture to help in the management. Treatment will 
involve either switching the drug to something that produces less sexual 
side effects or medicines like sildenafil and clomiphene citrate.
