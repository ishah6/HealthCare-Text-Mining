I do understand your concern for excessive and prolonged periods. Menstrual 
irregularities can be caused by many different factors. Hypothyroidism, 
hormonal imbalance, or a pelvic pathology may all lead to prolonged 
bleeding. The best next step in the management in your case would be to see 
your gynecologist for an internal examination and lab- work. A complete 
blood count, pelvic ultrasound, thyroid levels may be required to make a 
diagnosis.
