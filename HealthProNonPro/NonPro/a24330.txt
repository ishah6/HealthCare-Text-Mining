Diverticulosis is an outpouch in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract, most frequently in the colon.  In itself, its neither dangerous nor deadly.  Sometimes tics (diverticuli) will cause bleeding if theyre right on a blood vessel, and they can become infected, which is known as diverticulitis.  

The only way you can know for sure that you have diverticulosis is by seeing a gastroenterologist.  

The most common causes are thought to be age and lack of fiber in the diet.  

Some gastroenterologists believe that nuts, seeds, and foods such as popcorn should be avoided, but some will say that has no effect.  As far as I know, all agree that patients with diverticulosis should increase the fiber in their diet.
