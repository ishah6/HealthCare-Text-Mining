well...  a job is what you do to bring in a pay check.  A profession is more about the skills and education you have that are required in order to hold that job.  You can jump from job to job and they can be quite different.  Once you get into certain professions and the longer you stay in that profession, the more knowledge and skill you have and it is hard to just jump into another profession.  Say Criminal Justice to Medical.  Too much re-training and re-educating.
