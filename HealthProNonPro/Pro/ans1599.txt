This is a disorder of the inner ear caused by a change in fluid volume in 
the labyrinth. Meniere's disease is a syndrome characterised by spinning 
vertigo, hearing loss and tinnitus. Evaluation and management of dizziness 
and vertigo can be one of the most difficult medical tasks. The diagnosis 
of the disease is usually based on a careful history and physical 
examination by a doctor. Your mother may need to consult an 
otolaryngologist for further evaluation and tests like MRI brain scan, 
audiometry and blood-work like a complete blood count.Treatment depends on the symptoms. Vertigo and nausea can be alleviated by 
prochlorperazine, cinnarizine, cyclizine, or promethazine. Local steroid 
injection, surgery (endolymphatic sac surgery or vestibular nerve section) 
may be tried if medical management fails. A low-salt diet and avoiding 
caffeine, chocolate, alcohol and tobacco may also help.
