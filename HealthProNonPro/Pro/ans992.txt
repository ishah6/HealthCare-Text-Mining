Possibly during the sleep you are pressing the elbow and this is causing a 
compression on the ulnar nerve. The ulnar nerve is an extension of the 
medial cord of the brachial plexus. This is a mixed nerve that supplies 
innervation to muscles in the forearm and hand and provides sensation over 
the medial half of the middle, fourth and the entire fifth digit of the 
hand, the ulnar part of the palm, and the ulnar portion of the posterior 
aspect of the hand. Occupational therapy and work hardening programs are 
beneficial. Therapists may use and design splints to restrict the range of 
joint motion and cushions to ameliorate the effects of pressure. Use of a 
night splint is a common occupational or physical therapy technique that 
aims to limit the flexion and extension of the elbow at night. Therapists 
also use nerve gliding, sliding, or tensioning exercises which seek to 
promote smoother movements of the nerve within the ulnar tunnel and to 
reduce causes of physical nerve compression. Typically, nerves regenerate 
at a rate of 1 mm/day.
