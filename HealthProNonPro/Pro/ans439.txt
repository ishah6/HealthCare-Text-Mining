I do understand your concern for cervical cancer since your mother had it 
too. Cervical cancer is the second most common cause of cancer in women. 
Due to early detection the rate of invasive cervical cancer is on the 
decline.Studies show that having a first degree relative (mother, sister or 
daughter) with cervical cancer may increase your risk of developing the 
disease. The main risk factor for cervical cancer are HPV infection 
(especially HPV 16 and 18), sex at an early age, multiple sexual partners 
and smoking. A Pap test can detect cancer or abnormalities that may lead to 
cancer of the cervix. The test is performed at 21 years and repeated every 
2 years till 30 years.However, according to the symptoms you've presented, you are most probably 
having bacterial vaginosis. I would advise you to consult your doctor for 
further tests and antibiotics if needed. You may also need vaccination 
against HPV infection. Gardasil & Cervarix have demonstrated very high 
efficacy in preventing HPV infection.
