I got mine at 14, and had no cramps until I was 17.  Then they got really bad -- so bad that I would sometimes vomit.  The tricks is to start taking advil as soon as you get your period -- you need to start taking advil (not tylenol -- you need ibuprofin, which is in advil - because that actually controls the muscle spasms that cause the cramps) before the pain gets bad.  Also, if you use tampons rather than pads, it feel much better-- you dont feel the "dripping" or feel like youre wearing a diaper. If you have trouble using tampons -- start with plastic applicators -- they make insertion much easier - and try to relax.  Tampons and advil, when used correctly and on time, really help your period not be so bad -- and youll learn to know when youre getting your period so you dont leak -- usually the cramping starts a little lightly a few hours before anything starts dripping (usually youll notice a pink tinge on the toilet paper a few hours early too) -- so you can learn to recognize it.

I went on the birth control pill at 24 -- and that makes the cramping go away and the blood flow far less heavy.  The pill is really nice for making your periods not be a pain at all -- and it clears up any acne you may have.  The pill is not just about preventing pregnancy -- good luck!
