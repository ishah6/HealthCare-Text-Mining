thats a good question i have heard both also, but the question u should be asking yourself is why do you want it anyway? to grow? are u short? want to get healthy? be more energized? the best way to do this is by living a healthy lifestyle and eating right. yeah i know it gets old but hey would u rather live with knowing u cheated ur body into "health"?
