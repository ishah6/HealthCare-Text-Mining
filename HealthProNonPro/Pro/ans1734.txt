Whether or not you can get infected from herpes depends on your body's 
immunity. There is no cure for herpes, yet the immune system has the 
potential to suppress the symptoms of the infection. It is because of 
differences in immunity that cause certain people have outbreaks of cold 
sores and genital herpes while others may not. It is because of the 
uncertain nature of the body's defence mechanism that makes us unsure 
whether one is prone for HSV infection or not.
