The only way to rule out for sure a fracture is with Xrays. There are 
other signs that may help as: bruising, swelling, deformity and limited 
range of motion along with pain. In the view that you only have pain, no 
bruising, swelling or deformity, possibly you have a post traumatic 
tendinitis in the index finger. Conservative treatment includes: rest (you 
need healing time!), ice, stretching and strengthening exercises, 
non-steroidal anti-inflammatory meds (“motrin”, “aleve”).
