im pretty sure its like a month you can go. your first sign is that your hunger panes will stop. then youll slowly lose your muscle strength until you cant move very far at all. and your sight will go blurry not to mentyion possibility of nasea. what your talking about isnt a hunger strike its anemia. and when you want to start eating again, you may not be able to cause your mind forgets to swallow. so be prepared to  have an iv stuck in you for years.
