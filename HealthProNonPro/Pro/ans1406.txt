The most probable cause of drowsiness is due to R cin (Rifampin). This is a 
bactericidal drug that is often used in combination with other drugs for 
the treatment of tuberculosis. If drowsiness is a problem, your mother can 
take the drug one to two hours after a meal. She can also take it with a 
full glass of water and food if upset stomach occurs.
