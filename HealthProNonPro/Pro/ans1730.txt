When the abdominal wall is weakened, intestines or other organs may bulge 
through the opening resulting in an abdominal hernia. Hernias may be 
acquired as a result of increased abdominal strain due to heavy lifting, 
coughing, or infection of incision after surgery.Surgery for hernia depend on the site and presenting symptoms. Large 
hernias need to be operated due to the risk of intestinal obstruction and 
strangulation of blood flow. Hernias are repaired with surgery which 
involves the repair of a defect in a layer of the abdominal wall. The 
procedure is not considered major surgery. The cost of the procedure may 
vary significantly depending on your location. This issue is best discussed 
with your surgeon.
