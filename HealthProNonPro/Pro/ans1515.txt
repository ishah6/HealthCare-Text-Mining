The transverse cervical ligament by a degenerative process may be thickened 
or even calcified at the level of the Atlas (first cervical vertebrae) or 
the Odontoid (second cervical vertebrae), if this was only a finding and 
you do not have any symptoms this is good news. The symptoms that may be 
present in the future are: neck pain, stiffness and movement limitation. If 
the circulation of the CSF is compromised then there may be headaches, 
nausea, vomit, increased intracranial pressure.
