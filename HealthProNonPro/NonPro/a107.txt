As mentioned by venkat_raja_a, the reality is that your diet is most likely the cause of your acne.  

Your skin, like your kidneys and bladder, is another system in your body for eliminating toxins.  Toxins come from your environment and from what you eat.  If what you eat doesnt digest well or if its crap to begin with, your body wants to get rid of it.  It will poo it out, pee it out, barf it out or sweat it out.  The sweating part is where the acne comes in.

Unfortunately, for most people, becoming vegetarian, while certainly admirable, is not a viable option.  May I suggest paying attention to what you eat for a week and how your body reacts to it.  You could jot it down in a 7-day journal and try to keep track of approximate times.  If you feel bloated, stomach pain, or tired and lethargic, write it down.  After the week, you may notice that you feel crappy after you consume certain foods.  You will certainly be more aware of how food affects you. 

Common food allergies include dairy, wheat and soy.  Eliminating the foods that dont work for your body will cause your skin to clear.  This includes junk food and excessive consumption of meat.  By excessive, Im talking about more than once a day or big steaks.

Your skin will not clear instantly.  It takes a few weeks for your body to clear itself out.  However, once you do, youll feel much better and your skin will be improved.
