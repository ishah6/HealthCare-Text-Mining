Thank you for your question. It is possible that you are experiencing a 
condition due to scar tissue obstructing the passage of stool during a 
bowel movement. It can also be possible that the pain you are experiencing 
could be due to the development of hemorrhoids which is causing your pain 
as well. It is important that you report your symptoms to your surgeon and 
have them examine you to determine if there were complications with your 
surgery. You will need to have a rectal examination, and a stool occult 
blood test to determine if you are bleeding. Your surgeon may want to use a 
rectoscope to visualize within your rectum to determine if there are any 
complications with this surgery. Please be guided accordingly.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
