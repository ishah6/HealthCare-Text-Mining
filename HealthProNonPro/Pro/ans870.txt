Microgestin is an oral contraceptive containing norethindrone and ethinyl 
estradiol. The drug comes as a tablet and needs to taken by mouth. 
Unfortunately the drug will not be absorbed into the system if taken 
sublingually. You may try giving your girlfriend anti-emetics before taking 
microgestin. If this does not help, she may need to take the pill the next 
day if she feels better. If your girlfriend misses 3 doses or more, she 
need to see her doctor.
