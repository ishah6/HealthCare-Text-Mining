Thank you for your question. It is possible that the pain you are 
experiencing while tensing could be due to an issue with circulation to the 
penis. The blood vessels supplying the penis can become occluded or 
incompetent resulting in pain. In order to determine if this is the case, 
we recommend that you consult a urologist who will examine you and perform 
an ultrasound of your penis to determine if you are having this problem.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
