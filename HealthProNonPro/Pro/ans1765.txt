You are probably experiencing menometrorrhagia. This condition presents 
with prolonged and excessive menstrual bleeding. It can occur due to a 
hormonal balance, fibroids, endometriosis or endometrial cancer. The 
treatment will depend on the cause. It is important for you to see your 
doctor to rule out malignancy as the cause of the heavy menstrual bleed. 
Your doctor may also put you on an oral contraceptive pill to regulate your 
period.
