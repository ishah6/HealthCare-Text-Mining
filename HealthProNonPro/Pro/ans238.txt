Dizziness and vertigo may be caused by numerous conditions. In my opinion 
according to the symptoms that you've presented, the most probable 
diagnosis would be an eustachian tube dysfunction.The eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the throat. Its purpose is 
to equalize middle ear pressure with environmental pressure. Occasionally 
people develop symptoms when the eustachian tube does not equalize pressure 
(commonly seen after a cold). This may involve pain, fullness and dizziness.Diagnosis is of eustachian tube dysfunction is made by tympanometry. 
Treatment involves medications such as decongestants, systemic or local 
antihistamines and nasal topical steroids. Severe symptoms due to 
eustachian tube dysfunction may have a ventilation tube placed in their ear 
drum.
