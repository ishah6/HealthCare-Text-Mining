Every surgery has its concerns and it is reasonable to question the post 
surgical effects. In your case it is possible to have a normal pregnancy 
after gastric bypass surgery. In fact it is often seen that women have all 
undergone gastric bypass surgery are more fertile and pregnancy is much 
safer.If you are planning for a gastric bypass surgery, I would advise you to 
consult your doctor or surgeon for preconception planning. Your health care 
provider may recommend certain nutritional supplements such as folic acid, 
vitamin B-12, vitamin D, iron and calcium in addition to a daily prenatal 
vitamin before and during pregnancy.
