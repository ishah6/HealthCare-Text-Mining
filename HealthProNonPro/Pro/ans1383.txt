The main usefulness of ultrasound is to confirm the gestational age of the 
fetus. Another benefit of the ultrasound can also pick up problems of a 
serious medical nature, such as blockage of the small intestine or heart 
defects. Some studies have showed that there was a strong association 
between the size of a collection of fluid at the fetal neck, called nuchal 
transluceny, and the risk of Down syndrome, making an ultrasound 
measurement useful as part of the first trimester screen. It is important 
to keep in mind that even the best combination of ultrasound findings and 
other variables is only predictive and not diagnostic. For true diagnosis, 
the chromosomes of the fetus must be examined. Since there was a error 
during ultrasound, a maternal serum screening can be done at 15 to 20 weeks 
of pregnancy to screen for Down syndrome and Trisomy 18 if you have not had 
a first trimester screening or integrated prenatal screening.
