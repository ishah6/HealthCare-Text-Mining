If left untreated, the infection can lie dormant for several months before travelling through the cervix to infect the fallopian tubes, leading to Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID). This can cause symptoms such as low abdominal pain, fever and painful sex. However, many women have a less acute inflammation that produces few if any symptoms. If untreated, PID can lead to blockage of the fallopian tubes and subsequent infertility. Chlamydia is now the commonest cause of PID, which is thought to affect more than 165,000 women a year. It is estimated that 25% of all cases of infertility are due to chlamydia infection. Using the Department of Health statistics for infection, it is likely that there were 640,000 people infected between 1999 and 2000, and approximately half of these were women. Approximately 10% of all women who contract chlamydia will become infertile as a result of PID. This equates to 30,000 women a year becoming infertile. The peak age for chlamydia infection in women is between 16 and 19 years. If the trend continues, it is possible that, in 10 years time, there will be around 300,000 infertile women, aged between 26 and 29.
