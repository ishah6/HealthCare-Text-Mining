Genital warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). This virus 
usually produces no symptoms and hence an infection is not always obvious, 
however, once a person is infected with HPV, the infection is life long. 
HPV is spread through skin-to-skin sexual contact and not by penetration or 
exchange of body fluids, and so using a condom does not guarantee 
protection since the virus can be on an area of skin not covered by the 
condom. Surgery may be recommended if the warts do not respond to medical 
treatment, are widespread or the patient is pregnant. In 50% of HPV cases 
treated with surgery, the warts return. Furthermore, the HPV virus is 
transmittable even when the warts are not visibly present.
