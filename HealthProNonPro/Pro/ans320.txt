From your glucose levels, it is probable that you have an impaired glucose 
tolerance (IGT). IGT is comparable to prediabetes, in which the glucose 
levels are higher than normal but not high enough for a diagnosis of 
diabetes. It is usually seen that patients diagnosed with prediabetes 
develop type 2 diabetes within 10 years.It is encouraging to note that you've taken the right step towards 
controlling your high sugar levels. Lifestyle modifications reduce the 
incidence of diabetes by 50-60%. I have also noted that your doctor has 
started you on cetapin (metformin). Metformin improves insulin sensitivity 
in patients with IGT and is known to reduce the incidence of diabetes by 
about 30%. Certain studies have shown that Patients with glucose 
intolerance treated with metformin for up to 3 years were less likely to 
progress to type 2 diabetes. It is best to continue taking metformin unless 
you've developed severe side effects to the drug which include nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal bloating sensation and loose stools.
