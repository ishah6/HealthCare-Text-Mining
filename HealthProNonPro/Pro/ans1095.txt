Symptoms of vomiting, increased frequency of urination and sore breasts are 
very unspecific and though they could be signs of pregnancy, they could be 
due to many other conditions. They only way for you to find out whether you 
are pregnant or not is by doing a home pregnancy test. These tests are 
pretty standard nowadays and are fairly accurate. However the best time to 
take them is after a week or more of a missed period. Do the test early 
morning with the first urine sample. I hope I have answered your question, 
take care.
