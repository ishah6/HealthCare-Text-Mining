Urine tests for pregnancy are most sensitive 2-3 weeks after conception. A 
blood pregnancy test is more sensitive and will be able to determine 
pregnancy even after 1 week of conception. Sometimes stress may also lead 
to a delayed period. Please consult your family physician in order to 
conduct further testing . All the best.
