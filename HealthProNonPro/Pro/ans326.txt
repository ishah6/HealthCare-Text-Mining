Ganglion cysts are commonly seen at the back of the hand and wrist and may 
be caused due the irritation and repetitive movements of the tendons. The 
diagnosis of these cysts are by physical examination with x-ray of the 
joints to rule out any problem of the joint. These cysts often change in 
size and may disappear completely without treatment. Treatment is mainly by 
observation and surgery is only required if the cysts interfere with the 
movement or become painful and limit activity. An aspiration can be 
performed to remove the fluid from the cyst and decompress it. I hope the 
information helps, take care.
