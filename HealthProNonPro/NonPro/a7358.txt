Congratulations on your weightloss thus far! 

I lost 55 pounds once. I hit a couple of nasty plateaus. Here are some strategies I used to get over them:

- Break out the measuring cups and spoons and food scale again. I tended to get lazy about measuring my food over time. While on a plateau I forced myself to measure everything that went into my mouth that wasnt already pre-packaged and labeled with nutritional information.

- Try a different type of workout. If Id been doing the exercise bike regularly, instead of pushing myself harder on the bike and getting frustrated, Id move to a different machine - the stair stepper, elliptical, or rower. My body wouldnt be as used to the other machines - theyd work out different muscles so I wouldnt have to push myself as hard and would get more benefit.

- Re-examine the reasons why you want to lose weight. Cut out some pictures from magazines of how youd like to look, and also break out pictures of how you looked before your weightloss, and stick them on the fridge and food cabinets. Itll remind you of how you dont want to become and where you really want to be at the time youre making a judgement about what foods to eat.

- Wear a pair of jeans that is really tight around your waist. (around the house probably is best ;-) ). Itll make you think about your stomach more and motivate you to eat less and work out more. 

- Limit the amount of times you eat out per week, or if you eat out, have them bring out a take-home box when they bring out your food so you can spoon out half to take home right away so its not sitting there on your plate tempting you while you eat.
