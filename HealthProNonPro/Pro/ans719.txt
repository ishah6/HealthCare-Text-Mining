It is difficult to point out the cause of the vomiting but it is unlikely 
for it to be related to the traumatic events in the family. Severe vomiting 
may result in the loss of electrolytes especially potassium so it is 
important for you to take your daughter to her doctor for physical 
examination and further tests. The vomiting and abdominal cramps may be 
due to gastroenteritis or food poisoning, but we may need to rule out 
meningitis as the cause of the vomiting. The treatment will depend on the 
cause and whether signs dehydration are present.
