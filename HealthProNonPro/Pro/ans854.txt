Medifast is popular a diet plan, which consists of pre-planned meals. 
Medifast is portion-controlled, nutritionally balanced, low-fat, diet 
program that helps in faster weight loss and is more effective than 
traditional diet plans. The Medifast meals come in individual packets that 
is mixed with water and microwaved and is available in a wide variety of 
foods and flavors. The Medifast plan provides 800 to 1,000 calories a day, 
which makes it a "very low calorie" diet, which should only be undertaken 
with a physician's supervision. Very low calorie diets can lack important 
nutrients, which is why medifast provides a variety of meals. I would 
recommend that you consult your doctor or dietitian before starting on the 
medifast diet.
