Though the medicine you are taking (solpadol, penicillin and ibuprofen) 
will not effect ejaculation, an overdose of these medication will certainly 
lead to liver and kidney failure. You may also be at risk for 
gastro-intestinal bleeding. I would suggest that you consult your doctor 
before taking these medicines in combination.
