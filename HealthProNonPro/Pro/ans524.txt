I do understand your concern. The abdominal pain that you are experiencing 
is most probably menstrual pain. Taking over the counter pain killers like 
ibuprofen will help ease the pain. If you continue to experience severe 
abdominal pain, I would suggest that you consult your doctor for further 
investigations. It is essential to rule out acute appendicitis, 
endometritis and kidney stones which may present with similar symptoms.
