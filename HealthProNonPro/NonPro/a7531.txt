One of the chosen best answers (Courtesy BXCellent) is this 

You can be stretched, or have your legs broken and recast with pins. Its all the rage in China...

The doctor "breaks his patients legs, then attaches metal pins to the separated bones, which are held in place by metal frames around the patients legs.

The patient then has to twist a knob daily to drag the ends of broken bone apart gradually, encouraging new bone to grow to bridge the gap as the fracture heals, resulting in longer bones, and a taller person".

I would suggets dont worry a lot about that. You are probably the average height of man around you. Just be happy, smile a lot, and enjoy! :)
