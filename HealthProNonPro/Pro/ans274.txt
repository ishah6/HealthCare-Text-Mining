Erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a good indicator of presence of 
inflammation in the body. An elevated ESR may indicate infections, 
autoimmune disorders (SLE and rheumatoid arthritis), kidney and thyroid 
problems and cancer. A chronic high ESR level may need to be evaluated for 
underlying diseases.
