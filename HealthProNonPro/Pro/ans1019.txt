Psoriasis is a chronic skin disorder characterised by excessive 
proliferation of the the keratin cells in the skin resulting in thickened, 
scaly plaques. There is itching and inflammatory changes of the skin. 
Regular bathing can minimize the excessive scaling but care has to be taken 
to choose the appropriate products for bathing. Over the counter soaps 
containing mild antiseptics, salicylic acid and moisturisers help to 
relieve the inflammation in the skin. More severe cases may need 
corticosteroids and coal tar products. It is essential to avoid scented 
soap and lotions which have a alcohol base.
