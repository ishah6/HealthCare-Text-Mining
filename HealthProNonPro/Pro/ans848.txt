Maybe your symptoms have to do with a varicose vein problem, therefore I 
suggest that you get an evaluation by a Cardiovascular surgeon in order to 
rule out a possible vein valve incompetence problem or any other more 
serious circulatory condition. In the meantime it will be important that 
you try to lose weight and keep a consistent exercise routine, for example 
walking for about 45 minutes at least three times a week.
