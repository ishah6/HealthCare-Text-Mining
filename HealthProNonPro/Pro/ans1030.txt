Regular periods after a C-section may not be exactly regular. Factors like 
breastfeeding, and medical conditions such as thyroid problems, significant 
weight loss or gain and increased stress can influence the periods. Usually 
normal menstrual cycles should begin anytime after 2-3 months, but this may 
vary from individual to individual.
