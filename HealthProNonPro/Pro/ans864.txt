Methanol, also known as methyl alcohol, is a clear, colourless flammable 
liquid. Methanol toxicity has been most often linked to ingestion 
(drinking) of the chemical. People who ingest the chemical must receive 
medical attention immediately. The most common way that workers may be 
exposed to methanol at the work site is by inhaling methanol vapours or by 
absorption through the skin (either by contact with methanol or its vapours 
or with methanol-contaminated clothing). A significant amount of methanol 
can be absorbed through the skin, causing the same health effects as with 
inhalation, including blindness and optic nerve damage. Drowsiness, coma 
and death have also been reported, depending on the amount of exposure. If 
you experience irritation of the eyes (problems with vision) or skin and 
have difficulty in breathing, nausea or vomiting, I would suggest that you 
go to the ER immediately.
