It is difficult to say which date you should go by. Generally ultrasound 
dating is more accurate and earlier the ultrasound more the accuracy. But 
it really does not matter as the dates are pretty close. Generally I'd go 
with the EDD unless you're not sure of the LMP, in which case you may need 
to go with the AUA (average ultrasound age).
