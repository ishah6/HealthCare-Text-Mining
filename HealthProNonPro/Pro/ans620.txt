Important consideration in the acute management of atrial fibrillation is 
the need for anticoagulation. Effective anticoagulation in patients with 
atrial fibrillation reduces the risk of stroke 3-fold after 4-6 weeks. The 
newer drugs that your doctor may consider are :i) Dabigatran (Pradaxa) appears to be at least as effective as warfarin, 
it is more expensive but has a better safety than warfarin.ii) A new anticoagulant, rivaroxaban (Xarelto) was recently approved by the 
FDA.iii) Enoxaparin is a low molecular weight heparin that may also be used.
