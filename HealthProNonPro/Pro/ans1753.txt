You already have two previous knee surgeries in the left knee according to 
the past medical history that you provided. Then in the view that you are 
still having problems with the same knee I strongly recommend a 
comprehensive evaluation, including new imaging tests (MRI) to determine 
which structures are having problems this time and proceed accordingly with 
the right treatment choice.
