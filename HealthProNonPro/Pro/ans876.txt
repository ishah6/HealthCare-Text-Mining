Mirena is an intra uterine device that delivers small amounts of hormone 
directly to the uterus. Made of soft, flexible plastic, it is put in place 
by your healthcare provider during an office visit. It is possible to 
experience menstrual irregularities within 3 months of IUD insertion. 
However, I would still suggest for you to see your doctor to make sure 
there is no concurrent pregnancy which requires removal of the IUD.
