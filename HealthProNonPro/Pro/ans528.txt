I do understand your concern. The symptoms that you have mentioned can be 
either to a spasmodic musculo-skeletal strain of your back, sciatica or an 
impinged nerve caused due to a herniated disc. The only way to diagnose 
these conditions is by a thorough physical examination and x-ray or CT of 
the lumbar spine. I would suggest you to consult an orthopedic surgeon for 
further management.
