Its one of the best ways. Plus watch what you eat. 

Try walking. Do it daily at a steady pace for at least a half hour.  Dont amble.  Also try to do a little bit of weight lifting yoga and stretching about 3-4 times a week. When the walking and exercising starts to seem to easy, add to it. 

Watch your diet.  Cut out the french fries, chips, cookies, donuts, white bread.
Add fruit, veggies and drink water. 

Write down what you eat and when. Keep track of your exercise.
