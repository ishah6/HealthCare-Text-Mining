In the view that you have previous history of asthma and the symptoms are 
escalating, I strongly recommend you to go ASAP to the ER. Possibly you may 
have a severe allergic reaction called Anaphylaxis, if you are having now: 
difficult to breath; the hives are spreading beyond the sting, swelling of 
the face, throat, wheezing, difficulty to swallow, rapid pulse, dizziness 
or a drop in the blood pressure, get emergency treatment as soon as 
possible.
