According to your description, your age and the chronology of the events, 
I strongly recommend you to get an appointment with your doctor to rule out 
possible vitamin deficiencies (Vitamin B12), nerve compressions at the 
level of the spine, problems with the peripheral nerves of hands and feet, 
and other metabolic causes as problems with the Thyroid gland and Diabetes. 
All these mentioned above may cause the symptoms that you described and 
also a TMD.
