Dysmenorrhea is menstrual pain with no underlying pelvic disease. Primary 
dysmenorrhea is when there is high levels of prostaglandins which cause 
stimulation and contraction of the uterine muscles. Secondary dysmenorrhea 
is cause due to an underlying condition. The most common causes are 
endometriosis, adenomyosis, ovarian cyst, uterine polyps and adhesion. I 
would advise your sister to see her doctor for a complete physical 
examination and tests. Application of warm compresses to the lower abdomen 
and painkillers like ibuprofen may help to relieve the pain.
