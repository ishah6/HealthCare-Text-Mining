According to your history, it seems that you may have a parasitic infection 
of your intestines. Taenia saginata or beef tapeworm live in human small 
intestines and is caused by eating raw or undercooked beef or pork.I would suggest that you visit your doctor and have your stool examined for 
ova and gravid proglottids of the parasite. Anti helminthic therapy with 
albendazole or praziquantel is required in the presence of infection.
