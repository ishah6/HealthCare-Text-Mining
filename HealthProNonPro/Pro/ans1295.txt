Thank you for your question. Your testing is negative for any acute 
infection. It is possible that your increased values could be due to poor 
testing accuracy or due to the fact that you may have had immunizations for 
hepatitis B. You cannot be partially infected with any of these blood born 
pathogens. Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
