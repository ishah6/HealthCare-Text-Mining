It is difficult for me to tell you the exact cause of your lower abdominal 
pain on history alone. There could be several cause of right lower 
abdominal pain, which may include appendicitis, urinary tract infection, 
muscular strain, pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian cyst and 
constipation. My advise would be to take pain killers like advil or motrin 
to see if this help to relieve the pain. If your symptoms worsen, you may 
need to book an urgent appointment with your doctor or go to the ER.
