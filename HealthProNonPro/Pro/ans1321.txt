The cause of your abdominal pain may be due to appendicitis, urinary tract 
infection, pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian cyst, muscular strain, 
ectopic pregnancy or constipation. In your case, since the pain has 
continued 24 hours, I would suggest that you see a physician for a physical 
examination and diagnostic tests. A urinalysis, ultrasound and abdominal 
x-ray may be required to diagnose the cause of pain abdomen. Treatment will 
depend on the cause, I wish you well, take care.
