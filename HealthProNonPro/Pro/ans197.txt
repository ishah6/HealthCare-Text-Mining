Common cause of left sided abdominal pain are urinary tract infection, 
pelvic inflammatory diseases, ovarian cysts, muscular strain, ectopic 
pregnancy and constipation. If your symptoms are not relieved on over the 
counter pain medications, I would suggest consulting your doctor for a 
physical examination and diagnostic tests. A urinalysis, ultrasound and 
abdominal x-ray may be required to diagnose the cause of pain abdomen. 
Treatment will depend on the cause, I wish you well, take care.
