It really doesnt hurt.  It only tightens your teeth.  The braces pull your teeth closer together.  My son got braces on and I was there throughout the whole process.  It never hurt him.  The rubber bands they put on your braces only feels like its tightening your teeth.  Your mouth might be a little sore for a day or two but other than that, you will be just fine.  And just think, once those braces come off, you will have a beautiful smile.  Yes, sometimes they have to pull a tooth or two depends on where the tooth is located and if it will cause a problem to get the braces on.  Good luck
