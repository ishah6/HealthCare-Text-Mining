I just had to find out for myself. There is much more on that page that may help you. Also you might want to do a yahoo search on Thyroid Problems, or Thyroid Treatment and you find alot of stuff.
What Are the Treatments?
For thyroid disorders stemming from the over- or underproduction of thyroid hormones, both conventional and alternative treatments offer varied methods to restore hormone levels to their proper balance.  Conventional treatments rely mainly on drugs and surgery.  Alternative treatments attempt to relieve some of the discomfort associated with thyroid problems, or to improve the function of the thyroid gland through a variety of approaches ranging from diet supplements and herbal remedies to lifestyle changes and special exercises.  You should always receive a professional evaluation for any thyroid disorder; most of these conditions require a course of treatment beyond the scope of home care alone.
