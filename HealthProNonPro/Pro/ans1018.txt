Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin condition caused by an immune 
system respose. In psoriasis the normal skin is replaced at a faster rate 
than normal resulting in a buildup of dead skin on the surface. Psoriasis 
has a tendency to wax and wane with flares up in the presence of infection, 
stress, injury, dry skin and alcohol.Management of psoriasis may involve drugs, light therapy, stress reduction, 
climatotherapy, and various adjuncts such as sunshine, moisturizers, and 
salicylic acid. Preventing moisture loss which can occur from hot showers 
(take cooler showers) and apply a skin moisturizer after your shower and 
before you sleep is important.If steroid do not cause relief, coal tar, anthralin, calcipotriene, and 
tazarotene may be tried. Abruptly stopping steroid therapy in psoriasis or 
adding known irritant drugs can result in the sudden worsening of psoriasis 
or appearance of a new form.
