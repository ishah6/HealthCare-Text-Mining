Having had a deep cleaning done recently, I checked this out.  The correct name for "deep cleaning" is scaling and root planing.  It is done on people who are showing signs of early gum disease/periodontal disease.  It involves going in and removing plaque, tartar, bacteria, and contaminated root surfaces.  Although gum disease prevalence usually goes up with age, it is not uncommon to see mild cases of it in young adults, so having a deep cleaning done and following it up by doing proper brushing and flossing can keep it from progressing further and possibly requiring dental surgery.  A dentist will typically use local anesthetic if needed, so its not a painful procedure.
