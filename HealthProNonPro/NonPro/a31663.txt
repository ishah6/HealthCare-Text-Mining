it is still best to go to a physician for more diagnosis to this matter becoz what were talking here is a "person drinking a medicine". it is not a propriet enough to have a prescription becoz sometimes the symptoms are changing what if the medicine prescribe is not appropriet enough to the illness and it get worsen. so pls ask a physician or a psychologist first before you get a medicine
