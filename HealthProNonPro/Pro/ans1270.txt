Thank you for your question. This ultrasound finding indicates that the 
umbilical cord of the fetus was visualized over the back of the neck. It 
will be monitored in subsequent ultrasounds to make sure that it does not 
in fact wrap round the developing fetus' neck resulting in strangulation. 
If you are at the stage of pregnancy where you are able to feel your child 
moving around within the womb, please make sure you observe that the baby 
is moving regularly. If you notice decreased, or cessation of movement, 
please report this finding to your doctor immediately, and seek an 
emergency ultrasound to determine the well being of your baby.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
