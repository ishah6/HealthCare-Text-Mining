Eat a healthy, balanced, and small meal five times a day. Cut out extra calories like soda and candy, and dont use the fake sugers light nutrisweet because they increase appitite. Excerise 4 or 5 times a week for at least half an hour. Dont be discouraged if you dont immediatly lose weight because youll be converting alot of fat into muscle. Ignore your scale, put it away, check weight at your doctors office when you go there for regular health check ups. Most of all listen to what your doctor will tell you.
