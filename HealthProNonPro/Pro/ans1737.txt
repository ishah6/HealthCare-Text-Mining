While pityriasis alba is a relatively common skin disorder in children and 
young adults, characterised by dry, scaly white patches, it is difficult 
for me to comment without an examination. I would suggest that you consult 
a dermatologist for further evalualtion and a a potassium hydroxide (KOH) 
examination to rule out tinea versicolor, tinea faciei, or tinea corporis.
