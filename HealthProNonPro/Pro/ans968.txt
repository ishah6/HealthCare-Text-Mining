Pain located on the left side of the abdomen could be indicative of peptic 
ulcer disease, gastritis, kidney stones, abdominal muscle strain. You may 
try the available over the counter antacid medications like peptobismol, 
gaviscon, tums, zantac, pepcid etc. alongwith increased water intake and 
avoidance of spicy, oily and fatty foods. If this do not seem to help, 
endoscopy and ultrasound of abdomen may be the best option for 
investigation of the underlying cause.
