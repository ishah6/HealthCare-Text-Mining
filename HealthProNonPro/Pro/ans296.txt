Fetal movements before 25 weeks may not be easily discernible. As your baby 
grows, you'll be able to better distinguish his or her movements. The 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends noting the 
time it takes for your baby to make 10 movements. You should feel at least 
10 movements within a two-hour period.If you don't feel your baby move 10 times by the end of two hours, try 
again later in the day. Then if you still can't feel 10 movements in two 
hours, or your baby is much less active than normal, you may need to call 
your health care provider. Your doctor can do a nonstress test to check 
your baby's heart rate and movements.
