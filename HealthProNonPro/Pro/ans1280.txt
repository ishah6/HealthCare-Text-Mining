Thank you for your question. We empathize with how distressing your 
symptoms may have been. Dizziness during cold weather may be caused by 
redistribution of the blood in your body in response to hypothermia 
(decreased core body temperature). When the body temperature lowers, even 
very slightly, blood is redistributed to the most vital organs of the body, 
namely the heart, brain, and kidneys. This can cause you to experience 
symptoms of shivering, slurred speech, confusion, lack of coordination, and 
drowsiness. It is important that you have your doctor evaluate you for the severity of 
your hypothermia. Your symptoms can resolve without complication with time 
however it is important to get examined by your doctor to make sure you do 
not require further medical treatment. Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
