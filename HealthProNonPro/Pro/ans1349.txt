The headaches and the noises could be due to an eustachian tube 
dysfunction. The Eustachian tube connects the middle of the ear to the back 
of the throat and maintains the pressure in the inner ear. An infection or 
cold may block this tube leading to symptoms of fullness of hear, headache 
and disturbances in hearing. You will need to see an otolarngologist for 
further evaluation. Tympanometry is the investigation of choice.
