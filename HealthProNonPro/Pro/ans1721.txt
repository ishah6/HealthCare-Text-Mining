What you are referring to is bulimia. This involves periods of eating a 
larger amount of food than most people followed by compensatory behaviour 
like vomiting or using laxatives. If vomiting after food happens more than 
twice a week for 3 months it is considered abnormal and requires a 
psychologist/psychiatric evaluation.
