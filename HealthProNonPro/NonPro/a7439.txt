there are programs you can pay to join if you feel you have the time and $ to do so. this may sound cheesy but it works. the simple guide lines of the food pyrmiad. you can get that at your docs or even online. sensible eating in healthy portions. instead of diet it is just a wise way to live. wish you the best!!!
