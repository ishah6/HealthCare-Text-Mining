Thank you for your question. Darkening of the cuticle could be a normal 
process which is not associated with any serious medical illness. However, 
darkening of the cuticles could point to a possible developing fungal 
infection which would require medical treatment. In order to rule out a 
fungal infection of your cuticles, we recommend that you have your doctor 
examine your cuticles. If you are diagnosed with a fungal infection yo may 
be required to take oral antifungal medication to treat this infection.
