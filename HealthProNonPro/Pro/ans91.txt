Amoxicillin can interfere with the functioning of the oral contraceptive 
pill and decrease its effectiveness. I would advise alternative 
contraceptive measures like condoms when on amoxicillin. Smoking 
marijuana while on a birth control pill is not recommended.Women who smoke tobacco or marijuana while on the pill are twenty times 
more likely to develop heart disease than non-smokers.
