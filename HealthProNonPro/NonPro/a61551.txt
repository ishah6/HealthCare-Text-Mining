relatively low actually.  why ppl are telling you "high" and "50/50", im not sure.

first off, a girl is only fertile a few days a month plus the 3 days or so sperm survive in there, so thats still less than half the month. then theres the fact that sex during a females fertile period only has about a 25% success rate of pregnancy.
so right there thats low.  add on the fact that your "pull out" method perhaps was perfect- tho i doubt it. but in any event, at least there are far far far fewer sperm involved than if you hadnt pulled out.  add all that up and if you had to put money on it one way or another, you should be ok.

overall id say its not reliable at all, and certainly not responsible.  but if you made a bad choice and tried this once or twice, i wouldnt sweat it too much.  have her take a home pregnancy test if youre worried.  no amount of us telling you yes or no on here will give you the definate answer in your specific case.
just be aware that you are playing with fire and sooner or later youll get burned by this method.
