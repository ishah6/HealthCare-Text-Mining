Fever in a child is very stressful to a parent and I do understand your 
concern. Any temperature more than 38oC or 100.4 oF in a child or neonate 
needs to be evaluated. Though most cases of fever in young infants are due 
to benign viral illness, it is important to take your child to a 
pediatrician to rule out a more serious bacterial illness for example 
pneumonia, urinary tract infection, meningitis or bacteremia.An infant may provide certain clues like poor feeding, irritibility, 
breathing difficulty and abnormal cry that may warrant immediate attention. 
Well appearing infants may require to undergo a complete physical 
examination and appropriate laboratory tests like a complete blood count, 
blood culture, urinalysis for a proper diagnosis to rule out serious 
bacterial infection for which antibiotics may be required.
