There is a possibility that the itching could be caused by vaginal thrush. 
Usually the discharge seen in vaginal thrush is whitish in color and is 
accompanied by intense pruritus leading to redness and inflammation in the 
area. You may need an antifungal medication like fluconazole which is 
available both as an ointment and an oral medication. If your symptoms do 
not resolve with this treatment, then you may need see your 
doctor/gynecologist. A swab test may be done to identify the organism. 
treatment will depend on the cause. I would advise you not to use any other 
creams, tampons or deodorants in the affected area.
