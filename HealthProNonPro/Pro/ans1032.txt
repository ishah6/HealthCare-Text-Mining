Renting of scuba gear makes you prone to infections by bacteria, viruses 
and fungi. Bacterial infections include staphylococcus aureus, salmonella 
choleraesuis, pseudomonas aeruginosa, klebsiella pneumoniae and 
mycobacteris (tuberculosis); fungal infections include candida albicans. 
Your symptoms may also be a result of poisoning due to consumption of fish 
that was new to you. I would suggest you to visit your doctor for a throat 
swab and culture to determine the cause of the infection.
