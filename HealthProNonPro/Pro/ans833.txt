Loud noise does lead to some tinnitus, this usually develops over time with 
ongoing damage to the tiny sensory hair cells that are present in the inner 
ear that help in transmission of sound to the brain. But the fact is that 
most people develop tinnitus for no obvious reasons.If your symptoms are worsening and the tinnitus is load and causing you 
discomfort, I would advise you to consult with your doctor or preferably 
and otolaryngologist for further evaluation. An otoscopic examination and 
audiometric test may be required. If you are unable to avoid loud noise, 
you will need wear ear plugs or sound dampeners to prevent further damage.
