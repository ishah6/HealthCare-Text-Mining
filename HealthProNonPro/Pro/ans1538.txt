There are many causes of scalp swelling, the most common is trauma, 
physical abuse, acne, keratoacanthoma, blisters, Giant cell arteritis, 
allergic dermatitis, allergy to soap or shampoo.In the view that you do not 
recall any type of trauma or injury, possibly you may be experiencing some 
kind of localized allergic process. I suggest to visit your PCP and get 
evaluated to determine the cause and proceed with the right treatment.
