I am really sorry about your mom and what you are going through. I do 
understand your concern about depression and it is very acceptable to go 
through these feelings during times like these. A major depressive syndrome 
or episode manifests with five or more of the following symptoms :Depressed moodLoss of interest or pleasure in most or all activitiesInsomnia or hypersomniaChange in appetite or weightPsychomotor retardation or agitationLow energyPoor concentrationThoughts of worthlessness or guiltRecurrent thoughts about death or suicideTo make a diagnosis of depression, these symptoms should be present most of 
the day nearly every day for a minimum of two consecutive weeks and at 
least one symptom is either depressed mood or loss of interest or pleasure. 
It is very important for you to speak to your doctor or a psychiatrist 
about your symptoms. Regardless of the modality of treatment selected for 
initial therapy, the goal of treatment should be symptom remission. Your 
doctor make chose psychotherapy, alone or in combination with an 
antidepressant, if a diagnosis of mild to moderate depression is made. I 
hope I was able to answer some of your queries, take care.
