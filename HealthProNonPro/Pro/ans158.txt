Both pravastatin and lisinopril can cause side-effects that include muscle 
pain, tenderness, or weakness, lack of energy, extreme tiredness and flu 
like symptoms. I would suggest that you consult with your doctor regarding 
your symptoms and for appropriate tests. I hope the information helps, take 
care.
