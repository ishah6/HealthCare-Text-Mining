that depends on how fast you want to gain and if you want it as fat or muscle.

If you dont really care how you look and are just after weight gain - eat double the portions you are eating now. Concentrate more on protein and carbohydrates. Fast food is a great weight gainer. As well as chocolates, softdrinks, cakes, pastries, donuts, snackfoods, etc. (you know the food I mean) 

If you want to look fit as you gain weight, Id suggest a weight training program, coupled with increased food intake, not necessarily double your intake. Youll find that when you exercise your appetite also increases. Just feed that craving and exercise and youll see the pounds come on.
