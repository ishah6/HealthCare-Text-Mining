Boils are painful and cause concern if they are recurrent. They are caused 
when one or more hair follicles becomes infected with bacteria 
(Staphylococcus aureus). Damage to the hair follicle allows these bacteria 
to enter deeper into the tissues of the follicle and the subcutaneous 
tissue. Antibacterial soaps, antiseptic washes and washing your hands 
frequently may prevent the spread of infection. Also wearing loose fitting 
clothing of the boils may help prevent the injury of the hair follicle and 
prevent formation of boils. Larger infected boils will need antibiotics or 
surgical incision and drainage.
