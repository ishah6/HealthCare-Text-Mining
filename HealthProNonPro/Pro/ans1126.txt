Thank you for your question. Based on the description you have provided we 
have two hypotheses as to what could be causes these blisters on your glans 
penis. The first possible cause of your illness could be due to genital herpes. 
This is caused by the Herpes Simplex Virus. This virus is passed via sexual 
intercourse, oral sexual contact, or by kissing. When infected with the 
herpes simplex virus, one can be an asymptomatic carrier of this virus for 
years without knowing it until there is an eruption of genital herpes. The 
lesions of genital herpes appear as fluid filled blisters which can rupture 
and be painful. There are antiviral medications used to manage these 
outbreaks, however once infected with this virus, one is a carrier for life.Another possible cause of this is a bacterial infection of the glans penis 
and foreskin called balanitis. Balanitis is can become serious if left 
untreated, however if diagnosed it will respond well to topical antibiotic 
creams. At this point we would like you to promptly go to your doctor to be 
examined in person. Testing should be conducted for sexually transmitted 
infections, as well as a urine test to make sure the infection has not gone 
into the urethra or bladder. If this occurs, you will need oral medications 
as well. We hope you feel better soon.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com with your medical question.
