What you may be experiencing are simple motor tics. These motor tics are 
typically sudden, brief, meaningless movements that usually involve only 
one group of muscles, such as eye blinking, head jerking, or shoulder 
shrugging. These tics may increase as a result of stress, fatigue, anxiety 
or increased emotions.Your doctor may order necessary tests (EEG and MRI) to rule out other 
disorders such as seizures. The treatment for tic disorders depends on the 
severity of the condition. In many instances, no treatment is needed and 
the tics will resolve on their own. Doctors may prescribe behavioral 
therapy, medication, or a combination of the two. Behavioral therapy helps 
people learn to manage their tic symptoms and reduce tic frequency. 
Medications are typically used to reduce tic frequency and enhance a 
patient's daily life.
