Just make sure whatever you buy at the store has 5 grams of sugar or less.  Look at a Coke Sodas they have over 36 grams of sugar...not good.  

Im not a expert by no means...but last year I had a gained a significant amount of weight - like 15 pounds in one year.  So I started, scientifically, researching what was making me gain so much.  Im not a big eater...but I am a big snacker.  Every once in awhile Id go in the pantry and grab that Oreo Cookie...and then drink my Dr. Pepper.  Again...Im not a big eater so one oreo cookie was suffice.  But I  could drink sodas all day.

Now I stay away from sodas and I also eat snacks that have 5 grams of sugar or less.

Amazingly enough...without working out...Ive lost 20 pounds in one year - and that was giving up the huge amounts of sugar I was intaking.
