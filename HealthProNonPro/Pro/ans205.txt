Constipation is frequently seen when a child is weaning and when a new food 
is introduced. Other causes could be not getting enough fluids and low 
fiber intake. When babies start eating solid foods after six months, foods 
that contain fibre are important to help with regular, soft stools. Foods 
with fibre may also help with constipation. Fibre is found in grain 
products, vegetables, fruits and legumes (beans, peas and lentils). When 
offering solid foods, offer breastmilk or formula first and solid foods no 
longer than 15-20 minutes after. Offer sips of water in a sippy cup. Water 
should not replace your baby`s intake of breastmilk or formula.
