Thank you for your question. If you have recently lost weight it is 
possible that this could have become noticeably visible on one side of your 
face. This could account for this disproportionate sunken appearance of one 
of your cheeks. Besides this sinking appearance, you have not described any 
other associated symptoms which could be related to another illness so we 
recommend that you follow up with your doctor for an in person examination 
and evaluation of this.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com with your medical question.
