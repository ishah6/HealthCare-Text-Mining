The pimples that you are seeing may probably be pearly penile papules which 
are nerve ending and a commonly seen in young adult males. No treatment is 
required unless for cosmetic reasons. If you are concerned about a 
contracted sexually transmitted infection and HIV, I suggest you to consult 
your family physician and get yourself tested for HIV and STDs. In some 
cases, the early infection of HIV may not be detectable in the blood-work. 
So an additional test may be done in 3-6 months to confirm the disease.
