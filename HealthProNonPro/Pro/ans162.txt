Breast discharge is sometimes seen in women who are not pregnant. It does 
not mean that there is an underlying problem but nonetheless should be 
evaluated by your doctor. The common causes of breast discharge are breast 
abscess, medications like oral contraceptive pills, cemetidine, anti 
depressant drugs and intra ductal papillomas. Other causes could be 
prolactinomas and breast cancer.It is probable that in your case the breast 
discarge is due to your contraceptive pill, though I would suggest visiting 
your doctor for physical examination and blood-work.
