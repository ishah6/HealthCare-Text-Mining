Thank you for your question. Head injuries in general area cause for 
concern and it is important to pay close attention for symptoms that 
require you to go to the hospital. If at all you feel dizzy, loos 
consciousness, experience memory loss or confusion, or notice bleeding from 
your nose. It is important to got to your nearest emergency room for 
evaluation. If at all you feel a sense of increase pressure in your head 
with an associated headache that is increasing in severity please go to 
your emergency room. At this point, given your current symptoms, we believe 
you should go to your family doctor or urgent care clinic to have the 
swelling on your head examined to make sure it is not fractured or if you 
may have sustained a concussion.
