Hello. I usually just try to relax by thinking of all the good things, or people I have in my life. You need to have positive people in your life also. U do not need anyone who always complain about how bad things are; everyone needs a boost once in awhile. I also like to listen to gospel music. It is just so soothing and inspirational. Reading a verse or two; chapter or two in the Bible related to what you are going through also helps.
