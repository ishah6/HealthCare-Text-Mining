Menopause is highly unlikely after tubal ligation. However, tubal ligation 
may cause menstrual irregularities or even cause perimenopausal symptoms. A 
health diet and regular exercise should relieve many of these symptoms. If 
symptoms are more severe, natural progesterone hormone can be used in order 
to maintain the hormone balance.
