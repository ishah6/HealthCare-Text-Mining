Multivitamins make up for any nutritional deficiencies in the mother's 
diet. While the supplements contain numerous vitamins and minerals, their 
folic acid, iron, and calcium content are especially important. Folic acid 
can reduce neural tube defects. Calcium during pregnancy can prevent a new 
mother from losing her own bone density, as the foetus uses the mineral for 
bone growth and iron helps both the mother and baby's blood carry oxygen. I 
would suggest that you take multivitamins that are especially prepared for 
pregnancy such as Centrum Matrena.
