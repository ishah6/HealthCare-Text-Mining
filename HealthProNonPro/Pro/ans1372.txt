The length of time it takes for the birth control pill to become completely 
effective as a sole contraceptive varies depending on the type of pill you 
use and when you start the packet of pills. You will usually need to use an 
alternative form of contraception such as condoms for at least seven days 
after starting, but your healthcare provider should be able to tell you 
exactly when the particular version of the pill you have been prescribed 
becomes fully effective against pregnancy. It will normally also say on the 
advice leaflet that comes with your pills. Take care.
