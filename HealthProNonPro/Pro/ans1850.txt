Your symptoms of abdominal bloating and weight gain may be explained by 
gluten sensitivity, but may not explain your irregular cycles.Gluten triggers an immune response that causes antibodies in the body to 
attack the body's own tissues especially the villi in the intestines. This 
leads to abdominal cramping, bloating, diarrhea. The diagnosis can be made 
by an intestinal biopsy.You may need to consult your doctor on the chances of gluten sensitivity 
causing your symptoms and also rule out other problems such as 
hypothyroidism and PCOS.
