Because youre addicted to it, just like me and about a hundred thousand million other people!
Because its a distraction from all the garbage (and work) in "real" life
Because it can take you anywhere you want to go anytime you want to
what can you do to curb it? well, you can sign up on the free netzero, they only give you 10 hours a month, then cut you off til the first of the next month. (or any other limited time ISP)
BUT...... internet junkie me, I figured out how to stretch even that into several hours a day...... look up web pages, quick copy and paste all the stuff into text document, then jump offline and read at leisure. you can even do this with email, paste emails into document, jump offline and read them, compose outgoing mail in document, then quick paste and mail while online. I did that for about a year, but it just wasnt enough, so am back to regular unlimited.  ::::::::::sigh:::::::::  gotta love it
