There are many causes of breast lumps. Breast infections or abscesses, 
breast cysts and fibroadenomas and breast cancer can all form lumps in the 
breast. Breast cysts are smooth, easily movable round or oval breast lump 
with distinct edges, so according to your history the lump is unlikely to 
be a cyst. It is very important that you get yourself examined to rule out 
breast cancer. I would advise that you schedule an appointment with your 
doctor for a breast examination. Your doctor may also require an 
ultrasound, fine needle aspiration or a biopsy to confirm a diagnosis.
