Mastoiditis is any inflammatory process of the mastoid air cells or 
posterior process of the temporal bone, the temple bone. Acute mastoiditis, 
also known as classic mastoiditis, is a rare complication of acute otitis 
media (AOM). Antibiotic treatment of acute otitis media is believed to 
have decreased the incidence of acute mastoiditis. Your son has one year 
with this issue, then, it is a Chronic mastoiditis,which is a more latent 
and sometimes clinically silent version of mastoiditis, is most commonly 
associated with chronic supurative or with cholesteatoma formations. 
Cholesteatomas are benign tumors of squamous epithelium that can grow and 
alter normal structure and function of surrounding soft tissue and bone. 
Mastoiditis is a clinically significant infection with the potential of 
life-threatening complications. Common complications include hearing loss 
and extension of the infectious process beyond the mastoid system. If the 
spread of suppuration is anterior to the middle ear via the aditus ad 
antrum, often spontaneous resolution occurs. However, if the spread of 
infection is to the intracranial region, deadly and devastating 
consequences may develop. Then, I strongly recommend you to seek medical 
assistance for follow-up ASAP.
