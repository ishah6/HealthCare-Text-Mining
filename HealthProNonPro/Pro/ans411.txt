I do understand that you are concerned. Pregnancy is the first concern when 
anyone experiences a delayed period and the effectiveness of a urine 
pregnancy test usually depend on the timing of the test. The test is 
usually positive after 2 weeks of the sexual act. If you are experiencing 
stress or are sick due to an infection or there is a change in your 
schedule for sleep, these factors too can cause a delayed period. If you 
are unsure of a pregnancy you may consult you doctor for a blood test that 
detects pregnancy at a much earlier date.
