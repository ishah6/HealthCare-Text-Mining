The thing about the common cold (rhinovirus) is that we have no natural immunity to its various strains, we simply need to fight each new strain as it comes along.  Over-the-counter medicines DO NOT FIGHT your cold, they simply make your symptoms easier to handle while your body does the work.  For me, I say, this takes too long and is unnecessary.  There must be a way to supplement our bodys natural defenses, to aid our body in its fight against this virus.

Recently, to prevent catching colds over and over again from my 350 kids at school, I started taking large doses of vitamin-C.  This is one of those "who knows if this really does anything" kind of preventions/cures, but I really think its helpful.  I recommend Emergen-C which comes in little packets that you dissolve in water - it is jam-packed with vitamins and whatnot to help aid your immunity.

Also, I know homeopathic remedies get a lot of flak.  But I have to say - just because the FDA hasnt run a test on these drugs doesnt mean theyre not effective.  A lot of homeopathic remedies come from herbs and plants, just as most medicines championed by the FDA (aspirin, for one, which is made from treebark) are also "herbal".

Look for a remedy called "Umcka" made by the company Natures Way.  (Check a nutrition or vitamin shop in the homeopathic section).  This is a liquid (drops) made of a plant found in South Africa, and I SWEAR it begins working instantly, as soon as you start dosing.  My school nurse recommended it to me and I soon learned that one of my seventh graders - who is NEVER out sick mind you - also swears by the stuff.

I couldnt get rid of an upper respiratory infection (viral, basically a chest cold) and as soon as I started taking Umcka my cough cleared up and a couple days later I was perfect.  Now when I feel the colds creeping, I dose vitamin-C and start taking Umcka.  So far Ive been cold free!  Thats not easy in a school full of kids!

Good luck.  Enjoy your trip.
