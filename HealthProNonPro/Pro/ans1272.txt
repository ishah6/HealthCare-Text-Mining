Thank you for your question. Urinary tract infections are not believed to 
be a cause of lichen planus. Lichen planus is a chronic skin condition that 
produces itchy, flat, red/purple lesions on the skin. It is believed to be 
an autoimmune condition of the skin. Certain medications like blood 
pressure medications can produce 'flare ups' of this condition. We 
recommend that you consult your doctor regarding the treatment of your UTI. 
If left untreated it can spread to your uterus, badder and kidneys which 
can be life threatening. Once treated, you will need to evaluated by a 
dermatologist to determine if you indeed have lichen planus.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
