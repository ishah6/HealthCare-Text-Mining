Metronidazole is an antibiotic drug used to treat bacterial infections. 
There are some points to bear in mind while on this treatment. 
Metronidazole is believed to have the ability to block the body's breakdown 
of alcohol, leading to an accumulation of a substance called acetaldehyde 
in the bloodstream leading to a disulfiram like reaction. The effects are 
nausea, vomiting, tachycardia, shortness of breath, intense flushing and 
headache.Although there has been little in the way of published pharmacological 
evidence to support this interaction with alcohol, I would suggest that you 
avoid alcohol for at least 72 hours after completing the treatment with 
metronidazole.
