Thank you for your question. It is possible that these lumps could be 
caused by a benign skin condition called fordyce spots. Fordyce spots are 
enlarged sebaceous glands which can be hard, and usually found in the 
genital area. Another possible cause of these lumps could be due to an 
infection with the human papillomavirus resulting in eruptions of genital 
warts. We recommend that you have this area examined by your doctor, and 
since these are newly discovered, it would be best to see your doctor 
promptly to have them examined.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
