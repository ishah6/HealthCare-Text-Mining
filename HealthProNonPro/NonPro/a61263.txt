Well, maybe you should think about getting closer to God.There is a emptiness we all carry around that we try to fill up with earthly things like sex,alcohol,other drugs,overeating.We are pretty creative as people on trying to fill that hole.As for the bad decisions you are afraid will come back and bite you on your ass, Pray.Ask for forgivness and guidence when these things come-up again.When you realize that things,people and drugs dont make you happy,take the next step to change it.My brother died 3-9-06.He lived with his matto as "Do The Next Right Thing".The last year of his life that was how he kept himself from making bad decisions.You cant go wrong doing that.God Bless, I hope this helped you.
