You are most probably experiencing a musculo-skeletal strain. Rest , 
analgesic ointments, good back support and medications like Ibuprofen 
(NSAIDS) will help. If you noticed that even after taking medications the 
symptoms are not improving, pain becomes more severe, or you develop 
breathing difficulty, you may need to consult your doctor. I hope the 
information helps.
