Infrahilar lymphadenopathy may be caused due to sarcoidosis, tuberculosis, 
fungal disease, pneumoconiosis and lung tumor. It would require further 
evaluation and tests by your pulmonologist to determine the diagnosis. Your 
doctor may advise for a complete blood count, a bronchoscopy and even a 
lymph node biopsy to make a diagnosis. Treatment will depend on the cause. 
I wish you well, take care.
