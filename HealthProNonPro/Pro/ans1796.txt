You will have to do a urine pregnancy test to confirm pregnancy. It is best 
if the test is done with the early morning urine sample. Sometimes stress 
can also cause a missed period. If your tests are negative and your periods 
have not returned to normal in 3-4 months, I would advise you to consult 
your doctor.
