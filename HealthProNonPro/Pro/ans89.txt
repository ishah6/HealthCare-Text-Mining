Although It seems unlikely that you may be pregnant, I would however advice 
you to get a urine pregnancy test just to be sure. Your symptoms of 
tiredness and lethargy could be caused due to emotional stress or thyroid 
problems. If your symptoms don't improve, I would advise seeing your doctor 
for further evaluation.
