Yellowish discoloration of the eyes could indicate an increased level of 
bile pigments in the blood as a result of certain diseases such as 
hepatitis. A liver function test will certainly confirm the presence of 
jaundice. Since you have no associated symptoms like itchiness, pain in his 
right abdomen or fever, it is difficult for me to tell. You will have to 
wait for your doctor's appointment and liver function tests to confirm the 
presence of jaundice. I wish you well, take care.
