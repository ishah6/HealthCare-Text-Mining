Most cases of acute diarrhea are caused by a viral infection of the gut. 
However, since you've mention that you are experiencing black stools as 
well as some red spots, I would advise you to visit the ER or consult your 
doctor to rule out bleeding from the intestines. A stool test and 
antibiotics will help in clearing the infection.
