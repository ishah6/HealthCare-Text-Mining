There is a possibility that the watery discharge could be amniotic fluid 
due to a premature rupture of membranes (PROM). In my opinion, you may need 
to go to the ER or see your obstetrician immediately to evaluate if the 
leaking is due to to PROM.Your doctor may analyze the discharge to determine that it is indeed 
amniotic fluid. Though most women who have PROM go into labour within 24-72 
hours, you may required a more emergent management if there is presence of 
meconium in the amniotic fluid.
