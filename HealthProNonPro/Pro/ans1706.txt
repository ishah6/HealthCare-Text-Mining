Vitiligo is an autoimmune disorder in which the cells that make pigment 
(known as melanocytes) in the skin are destroyed, resulting in white 
patches on different areas of the skin. The precise cause is unknown. Cases 
occur due to a combination of neurogenic, immunologic and genetic factors. 
There is a 25-30% chance that vitilogo may be familial. The mode of genetic 
transmission is unknown.
