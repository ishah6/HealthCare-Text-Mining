Sinusitis usually follows a viral upper respiratory tract infection and 
resolves in 7-10 days. Antibiotic treatment is usually 7-14 day in patient 
with acute sinusitis but can be prolonged in chronic cases.I would suggest you to complete 7 days of antibiotic before deciding to 
consult your doctor. Some ajunct therapies that will aid in faster relief 
are :i) Inhaled steamii) Nasal saline sprayiii) Avoiding smoking, dust and allergensiv) Oral and nasal decongestants
