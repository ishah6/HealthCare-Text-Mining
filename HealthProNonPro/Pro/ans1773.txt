You have mentioned that you are on Adderall 30mg for ADD, there is a slight 
possibility that the symptoms you are experiencing is caused by the drug. 
However, hypothyroidism and anemia may also cause similar symptoms. I do 
understand that the lack of medical insurance is a problem but in my 
opinion it is important to consult a doctor at an earlier stage than when 
the problem become more severe. I hope I could answer your question, take 
care.
