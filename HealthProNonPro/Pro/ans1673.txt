recurrent infections.The symptoms of UTI are burning sensation when urinating, pain lower 
abdomen and occasional hematuria (blood in urine). Vaginitis, acute 
urethritis, bladder cystitis and pelvic inflammatory disease may also 
present with symptoms of UTI.Your daughter may have to see her doctor for tests like a CT scan of the 
kidneys, ureter and bladder, Ultrasonography, urinalysis and culture to 
determine the cause of the infections. If a structural problem or kidney 
stone is detected the urologist may even perform a cystoscopy. treatment 
will depend on the cause of the infection. Drinking plenty of water and 
cranberry juice helps to reduce the recurrent urinary tract infections.
