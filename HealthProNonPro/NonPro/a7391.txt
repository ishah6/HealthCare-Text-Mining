I know nothing about Tamiflu, but I had taken Vioxx for very painful arthritis and for the first time found pain relief!  I felt great after years of suffering.  Despite the possible side effects, I would still take the Vioxx.  If it meant there was a possibility of heart complications- Id rather live a little less time than continue on in pain for years.  Besides which, while on the Vioxx, I became active and thus lost weight and was less depressed.  Possibly it may have increased my life span, in spite of possible side effects.
