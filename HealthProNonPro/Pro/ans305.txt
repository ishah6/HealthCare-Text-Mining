Finesteride is used to treat male pattern baldness (androgenetic 
alopecia). Finasteride's effects in slowing hair loss and stimulating new 
hair growth work best for early to moderate degrees of hair loss. Men with 
extensive hair loss are unlikely to experience much regrowth with 
finasteride. Various studies have found that finesteride increased the hair 
count and also provided an excellent safety profile. Finasteride for 
treatment of hair loss should be prescribed only after examination by a 
physician hair restoration specialist. I wish you well, take care.
