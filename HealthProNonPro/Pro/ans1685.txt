Uterine fibroid(s) (also called uterine fibroma) are benign tumors which 
grow from the smooth muscle layer (myometrium) of the uterus, also known as 
leiomyomas. They are the most common benign neoplasm in females. Often 
asymptomatic, they cause symptoms in about 25-50% of women often because of 
mass effect. Fibroids can range in size from microscopic to the size of a 
grapefruit or even larger. The majority of fibroids are small and do not 
cause any symptoms at all. However, some women with fibroids have very 
heavy menstrual bleeding or pelvic pressure or pain that interferes with 
their life. Larger fibroids can cause a sense of pelvic pressure or 
fullness in the abdomen. Fibroids can also cause other symptoms, depending 
on where ther are located in the uterus. For example a fibroid pressing on 
the bladder will cause increased urinary symptoms and similarly a fibroid 
pressing on the rectum can cause constipation.
