In my opinion there is no need for you to be concerned about the swelling 
in your chin. The most probable cause would be due to swelling of the lymph 
node because of the underlying sinusitis. The swelling should resolves 
shortly after the infection subsides. I would suggest that you gargle with 
warm saline and take over the counter anti-inflammatory medication like 
motrin/advil if there is tenderness of the swelling.
