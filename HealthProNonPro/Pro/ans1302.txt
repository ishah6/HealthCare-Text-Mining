Thank your for your question. If at any point you had unprotected sexual 
intercourse during this encounter, you would be at risk of contracting a 
sexual transmitted infection. These infections could range from treatable 
ones such as chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, and urinary tract infections, 
to incurable viral infections such as hpv, herpes, or HIV. You can indeed 
contract sexually transmitted infections from unprotected oral sex as well.Symptoms can range from painful, burning urination with a blood purulent 
(pus) discharge which would be found in chlamydia and gonorrhea, genital 
warts which can be painless and erupt many years after being infected. It 
is important that you go to your doctor and conduct a complete set of STI 
testing which includes swabbing of mucosal surfaces (mouth and penis), 
urine test, and blood work. This is the only way to be certain if you have 
been infected by with and STI.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
