A stye is formed when there is inflammation in the oil gland on the edge of 
the eyelid. Styes will usually resolve within a a week to 10 days without 
any treatment. You may aid the healing process by applying a warm compress 
to the area for about 15 minutes 3-4 times per day. Antibiotic creams may 
be applied if the swelling is severe. I wish you well, take care.
