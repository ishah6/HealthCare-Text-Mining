Generally the treatment of an acute Jones fracture consists of 
immobilization with a cast. You should not place weight on the foot until 
instructed by your doctor. Crutches will be used for the initial healing 
phase. Jones fractures can become chronic conditions if the fracture fails 
to unite, or heal. If this is the case, surgery will likely be recommended 
to secure the fracture in place with a screw, and bone graft may be used to 
stimulate a healing response. In some patients, especially competitive 
athletes, surgery may be recommended to try to avoid the lengthy healing 
period for a Jones fracture to heal. Surgery has associated risks that must 
be weighed against the need for timely healing. I suggest you to wait until 
your appointment and discuss with the doctor your treatment options.
