Thank you for your question. The medical evidence that is exists at present 
regarding the use of this melatonin, niacin for growth is inclusive. 
However, exercise and adequate sleep has been proven to be a vital 
component of healthy growth, and the prevention of disease. We recommend 
that you continue to exercise and have adequate sleep each day. We do not 
recommend taking melatonin and niacin supplements for the purpose of 
growing taller. In fact, growth is almost entirely determined by genetic 
inheritance from one's parents. Please be guided accordingly.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com with your health query.
