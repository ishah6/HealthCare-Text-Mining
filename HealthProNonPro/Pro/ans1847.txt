Your symptoms may be due to Eustachian Tube Dysfunction which is a small 
canal that connects the middle ear to the back of the nose and upper 
throat. Its purpose is to equalize the air pressure in the middle ear with 
the pressure outside it. Eustachian tube dysfunction (ETD) occurs when the 
tube fails to open during swallowing or yawning. This results in a 
difference between the air pressure inside and outside the middle ear. It 
causes discomfort in the ear and temporary hearing problems. If your 
symptoms are severe and last longer than a few weeks, consider seeking care 
from an ear, nose and throat specialist. Treatment options include Oral 
decongestants, Nasal spray antihistamines, Topical nasal steroids and 
Ventilation tubes, in severe cases, to drain fluid and relieve pressure.
