Unfortunately,you do not provided enough information about the old 
fracture, for example: was it just ulna, just radius or both bones that 
form the elbow? ; was it associated with dislocation? ; did you receive 
conservative treatment (cast) or surgical treatment (internal fixation 
materials)? . All these factors are important to determine the possible 
long term complications or outcomes. The only thing for sure is that you 
did not do follow up or did Physical Therapy. There are short term 
complications (compartment syndrome, injury of the brachial artery) and 
long term complications like: degenerative arthritis, reflex sympathetic 
dystrophy, lesion of the ulnar nerve. From all the mentioned, the ulnar 
nerve entrapment is one of the most common, probably that’s why you are 
feeling numbness and tightness. I suggest to visit the Orthopedic surgeon 
to evaluate your treatment options.
