If you only had problems with your PCL and medial meniscus you may have a 
repair surgery that will take care of both issues, but if besides, you also 
have severe degenerative changes in the knee jointthen you may require a 
knee replacement.After a knee replacement is very important to follow a 
proper physical therapy program, keep the weight under control and do not 
over stress the knee joints. If these measures are followed in most of the 
cases a total knee replacement can last 10 years or more before thinking in 
new replacement.
