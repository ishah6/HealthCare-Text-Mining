First congratulations on your weight loss.  But sadly the battle is never over.  Its a constant effort to keep the pounds off.  But I can say that I personally just lost 15lbs, simply by not drinking any more soda.  So if your still drinking high carb drinks......stop!.  Youd be suprised how much you can lose just by doing that.
