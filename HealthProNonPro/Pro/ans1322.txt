The cause of your indigestion could be either due to reflux disease or 
infection with H. Pylori. I would suggest that you see a gastroenterologist 
for an upper GI endoscopy and a urease breath test to rule out infection 
with H. Pylori. Treatment will depend on the cause. In addition i would 
advice you to analyze the food that you are eating and with which food 
product doses this reaction occur. All the best.
