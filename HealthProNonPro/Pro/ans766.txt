It is really difficult to tell whether you are pregnant or not. Your 
symptoms could be due to pregnancy but could also be due to other problems 
as well. Though oral contraceptive are very effective in preventing 
pregnancy if properly used, there is nothing 100% guaranteed. The bleeding 
could be your periods starting or an implantation bleed, it's difficult to 
tell. I would advise a home pregnancy test. Do it in the morning with the 
first urine sample.
