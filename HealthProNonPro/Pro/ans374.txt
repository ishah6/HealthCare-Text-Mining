High triglycerides level can increase the risk of heart disease. The target 
level for triglycerides should be less than 200. The first recommendation 
for lowering triglycerides is to decrease calorie intake. If you are at a 
healthy weight, decrease carbohydrate-rich foods to less than 50 percent of 
your calories and substitute heart-healthy fats for carbohydrates. 
Heart-healthy fats include canola oil, olive oil and liquid margarine. 
Nuts, olives and avocados also contain good fats. Moderate physical 
activity on five or more days each week can help lower triglyceride levels. 
It is also important for you to abstain from alcohol during this time.
