look the basic thing for loosing black circles is to have very good sleep. If you do not have these circles from your birth,which some peoples have, then i strongly suggest you to have a very relaxed and deep sleep at least 8-10 hours for a week at least. Look at the difference and then tell me. you can enhance this therepy by using a cream which i strongly suggest.you cancontact me if you can.
