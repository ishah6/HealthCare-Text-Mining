Severe pain and burning right behind the navel could be caused by acute 
appendicitis, an umbilical hernia or an umbilical abscess. You will require 
a detailed history and physical examination to determine the cause of pain. 
Though acute appendicitis is clinically diagnoses, you may require an 
ultrasound of the abdomen to see for an underlying abscess and umbilical 
hernia.
