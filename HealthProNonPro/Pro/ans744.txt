It is normal that after the cast removal, the elbow joint be stiff and 
painful with the movements and to the touch, that’s why is so important the 
rehabilitation after the immobilization. The longer the elbow is 
immobilized, the larger the flexion contracture and the more severe the 
pain. The first PT sessions are expected to be a little bit difficult and 
painful but the more movement and PT you do the more improvement you will 
get in the long run. It is a key concept in rehab post elbow dislocations 
that a short immobilization period (2-3 weeks) followed by and early, 
directed rehab process , allow early return to the daily living activities 
and sports participation. Unfortunately, there is no alternative better 
than Physical therapy and progressive mobilizations and exercises in your 
case. If the massage is hurting, the therapist should use first TENS or 
warm compresses to help you to manage the pain, also you could take anti 
inflammatory medication (“motrin”, “aleve”) before the therapy session. 
Hopefully , progressively you will regain mobility and the pain will be 
under control with the future sessions.
