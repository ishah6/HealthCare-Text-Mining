Ultrasound dating scans are fairly accurate if done early in the pregnancy. 
A scan done after 20 weeks of gestating may show variability and sometimes 
may indicate if the baby is not growing at a rate it should. The accuracy 
is also determined by the machine and the skill of the operator. I would 
advise you to speak with your doctor to determine the best possible date of 
conception. I hope the information helps, take care.
