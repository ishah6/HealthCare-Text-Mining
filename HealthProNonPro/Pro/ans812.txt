It would be important in your case to rule out a Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, 
that might be manifesting by the numbness of the palm of the hand and the 
burning sensation. This is not a common presentation of the CTS, but the 
possibility must be rule out. Carpal tunnel syndrome is a disease of the 
hand characterized by numbness, tingling, pain, and weakness. The disease 
typically affects the thumb, index, and middle fingers and is often 
particularly troublesome at night. A major nerve, specifically the median 
nerve, travels down the arm and enters the hand through the carpal tunnel, 
which is located in the central part of the wrist. In people with carpal 
tunnel syndrome, pressure in the carpal tunnel is higher than in unaffected 
people, and median nerve irritation occurs. The first line of treatment for 
mild carpal tunnel syndrome is to wear a wrist brace. This has been shown 
to relieve the symptoms from the carpal tunnel by placing the wrist in a 
neutral position and reducing the nerve irritation. Splinting is usually 
tried for a period of 4-6 weeks. Some people wear their splints at night 
only and others wear their splints both day and night, depending upon when 
the symptoms are at their worst.
