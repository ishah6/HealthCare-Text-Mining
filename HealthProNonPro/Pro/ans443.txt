I do understand your concern for infertility. Male infertility contributes 
to at least 40% of the reasons why couples cannot conceive. The most common 
male infertility causes come from a problem in sperm production. Other 
problems may be due to the fact that the sperm do not move or function 
properly, or because of blocked passageways. Disease, fevers or infections, 
and congenital abnormalities can also contribute to these problems in men.There have been studies that indicate smoking lowers sperm counts. My 
advice would be to stop smoking before attempting a pregnancy. Emotional 
stress, impotence, premature ejaculation can also contribute towards 
infertility.I would advise you to see your doctor for complete physical examination and 
semen analysis to determine the cause of infertility. treatment will depend 
on the cause. I wish you well, take care.
