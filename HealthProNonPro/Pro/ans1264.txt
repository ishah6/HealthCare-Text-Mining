Thank you for your question. This rash could possibly be due to an insect 
bite, however based on your based description we are not certain what type 
of insect could have caused this bit. We recommend that you follow up with 
your doctor to have this possible insect bite examined to make sure your 
child does not require further treatment. For example, if this bite was 
caused by a tick, then the child would be at risk of contracting a serious 
bacterial infection called Lyme disease. Please have your child seek 
medical attention.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
