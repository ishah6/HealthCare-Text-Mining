There are a lot of options these days- cervical cap, diaphragm, sponge, birth control pill, IUD, female condom, Depo-Provera, inplant, Ortho Evra, an NuvaRing.  It would be best to talk to your doctor about which choice is right for you and your body.  I would not recommend withdrawl as it has a very high rate of failure, and is like not using anything at all.
