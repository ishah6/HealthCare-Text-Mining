Stretch marks are caused when the skin is subjected to continuous and 
progressive stretching as in the case of pregnancy. What causes this to 
happen is not fully known and it is thought that genetic factors could play 
a role in the development of striae.Unfortunately getting rid of stretch marks completely is very difficult, 
total resolution of these lesions remains an unattainable goal. You may try 
application of creams containing vitamin E and cocoa butter for the early 
development of stretch marks. Topical application of tretinoin has been 
shown to significantly improve the clinical appearance, however, it should 
not be used in pregnant or breastfeeding women.
