Sometimes after a rib fracture, the intercostal nerve gets injured and 
this may take long time to heal. It is possible that the pain that you are 
experiencing is related with your previous history of ribs fracture. 
Intercostal Neuritis is not a serious condition but very annoying indeed 
and slow healing. By a spasm or a direct trauma the intercostals muscles 
and nerves got injured, and that’s why you are feeling that stabbing pain 
every time you take a deep breath, sneeze or cough.The suggested strategy 
would be: please, try to be patient and do not expect an overnight 
improvement, take anti inflammatory medication (“Aleve”, “Motrin”), and 
also Vitamin B12 supplement. Local moist heat helps to ease the pain. Try 
to avoid activities that worsen the pain.
