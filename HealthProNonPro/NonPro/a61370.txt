I had braces and teeth out when I was younger, and I am now so glad I did. It is sometimes painful (esp when they are tightened) but well worth it.  

I also had a brace to make my mouth wider - that was much more painful, it had a key which had to be turned each night to expand it.

Pain is difficult to measure, but I didnt find braces too unbearable.
