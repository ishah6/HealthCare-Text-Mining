Currants are actually just very small raisins--made from the Black Corinth grape--and are therefore a concentrated source of calories, sugar, and nutrients.  According to WholeHealthMD, they supply a healthy amount of dietary fiber (both soluble and insoluble), iron, potassium, and B vitamins.  The Worlds Healthiest Foods points out that raisins have been the object of phytonutrient research primarily for their unique phenol content, which helps prevent oxygen-based damage to cells in the body.  WHF also notes that these dried grapes are one of the top sources of the trace mineral boron.  Studies have shown that boron provides protection against osteoporosis and reproduces many of the positive effects of estrogen therapy in postmenopausal women.  So the tiny, wrinkled currants youre used to seeing only in scones and stuffing are actually very good for you!  Ideas for adding them to your day: sprinkle them on your yogurt or granola, over your salad or chicken, or mix them into your cookie or muffin dough.  Best,<br />
