A grey colored stool may indicate insufficient bile output due to 
conditions such as cholecystitis, gallstones, giardia parasitic infection, 
hepatitis, chronic pancreatitis, or cirrhosis. Bile salts from the liver 
give stool its brownish color. If there is decreased bile output, stool is 
much lighter in color. Your husband will need to see his doctor for a liver 
function test and an ultrasound to determine the cause.
