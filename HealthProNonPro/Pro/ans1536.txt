There are many causes of non-traumatic leg pain. Pain in the legs can be 
present because of several conditions that affect joints, muscles, tendons, 
ligaments, blood vessels, skin or nerves. According to your description , 
most likely you might having a Mononeuropathy, which produces a pain 
occurring from a peripheral nerve inflammation not associated with the 
spinal cord called Meralgia Paresthetica that causes pain in the upper 
anterior and inner thigh resulting from entrapment or inflammation of a 
nerve that leaves the pelvis. This type of pain tends to involve part of 
one leg only. The suggested strategy would be: conservative therapy, such 
as physical therapy, weight reduction to reduce abdominal girth, moist heat 
application, analgesics, anti-inflammatory medication (“motrin”, “aleve”) 
and avoid wearing constrictive garments, belts, or braces that impart 
excessive focal pressure at the lateral aspect of the thigh affected. If 
does not get better with these measures it is strongly recommend to be 
evaluated by a orthopedic surgeon and maybe consider the corticosteroid 
injection at the spinal or inguinal level which may provide more chronic 
relief of symptoms.
