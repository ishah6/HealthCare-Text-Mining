Tapeworms, pinworms, and roundworms are among the most common parasites 
that can be found in stool. Some parasites live in the intestines for a 
long period of time without causing any symptoms. I would suggest that you 
see your doctor for a proper diagnosis. Stool examination and serology 
assays may be needed to detect a parasitic infection. Treatment will depend 
on the specific organism found.
