Wheat/Gluten sensitivity is seen in 1 in every 7 people. Gluten is composed 
of the proteins glutenin and gliadin. In recent years some substantial and 
controversial studies suggest our bodies may not tolerate and digest gluten 
as well as everyone had always assumed.Gluten intolerance consists of celiac disease, non celiac gluten 
sensitivity and wheat allergy. The presence of gluten causes the immune 
system to release antibodies that destroy the villi in the intestines, 
resulting in decreased absorption of nutrients from the intestines. The 
symptoms of wheat sensitivity include abdominal distention, abdominal pain 
and cramping, bloating, constipation, skin rash (dermatitis herpetiformis), 
anemia, fatigue, headaches, bone density loss and arthritis.There is only one failsafe and accurate way to identify food intolerance 
and that's by eliminating wheat/gluten from diet.
