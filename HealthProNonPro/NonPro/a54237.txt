Why would you be that depressed?   That worries me a lot.   You need to eat something.   I have found in a situation like that some dark (not burnt)toast and a little orange juice worked for me.   The orange juice for some reason makes you want to eat.   The dark toast (unbuttered) seems to ease stomach tension and spasms  that are often associated with depression.    The trick is not to eat or drink either fast.  Take your time.    

Years ago I suffered severely from depression and had it hard wanting to eat.  Often we dont eat because we are too caught up in our feelings and just dont find time to be hungry.   We have to learn to eat even if we arent hungry
