you can take naturally cure your hiccups with yoga without any medication.If you suffer from hiccups, stimulate your wondrous vagus nerve with Jalandhara bandha. Heres how:
1. Take a comfortable seat with a long straight spine.
2. Exhale as you gently drop your chin towards your chest. The back of the neck will become long. Be careful to NOT drop the whole head forward which can strain the neck muscles. 
3. Inhale as you fill the chest with air and allow the sternum (heart center) to rise up towards the chin. The shoulder blades soften down the back as the chest stays lifted.
4. Hold this position and continue to breath.

I find that it only takes a few breaths and the hiccups are gone.Good Luck!!!
