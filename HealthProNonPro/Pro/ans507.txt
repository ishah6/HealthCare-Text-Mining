I do understand your concern. It seems to me that you are having an anxiety 
attack. An anxiety attacks is typically characterised by increased heart 
rate, sweating, nausea, feeling of going crazy usually in response to a 
stressor or a situation. Certain measures, if observed regularly, can help 
you deal with your symptoms. You should try to avoid alcohol, caffeine and 
excess sugar intake as much as possible. A healthy balanced diet including 
vegetables, fruits, cereals, meat,seafood and poultry will keep you healthy 
and help you think clearly. Relaxation therapy, yoga, meditation can help 
ease your stress and allow you to enjoy the pleasures of life. Routine 
exercise with daily walks and a balanced lifestyle will add to your 
confidence in deal with the panic attacks. If your symptoms persist even 
with these measures, then I would suggest that you see a doctor to rule out 
other conditions like a heart rhythm problem and thyroid issues.
