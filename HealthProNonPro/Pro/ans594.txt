If is difficult for me to say what could be the cause of aggravation of 
your symptoms after taking homeopathic drugs for migraine. Homeopathic 
drugs available for migraines with out without prescriptions sometimes 
contain St. John's Wort which can cause photo-sensitivity. If your symptoms 
are increasing in severity, I would advise that you stop your current 
medication and consult a neurologist for further workup. I would definitely 
advise a CT, MRI and perhaps an LP taking into consideration the worsening 
of your symptoms. It is necessary to exclude serious condition including 
meningitis and subarachnoid hemorrhage.
