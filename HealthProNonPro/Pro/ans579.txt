I would like to assure you that you have nothing to worry about. Rabies 
vaccine contains inactivated rabies virus. It works by provoking the body's 
immune response to this virus, without actually causing the disease. A 
vaccine, like any medicine, has certain side-effects. Serious problems from 
rabies vaccine are very rare. Mild problems include soreness, redness, 
swelling, or itching where the shot was given and headache, nausea, 
abdominal pain, muscle aches, dizziness - which occurs in 10 - 40% cases.
