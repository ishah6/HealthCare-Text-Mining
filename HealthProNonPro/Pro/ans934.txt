Nuratrim is a weight loss supplement. The main ingredient of the capsule is 
glucomannan a dietary fiber that is a supposed to increase satiety and 
prevent overeating. The ingredients of nuratrim have not been approved by 
the FDA and very is little is known about its long term side-effects.I would advise that you consult with your doctor/dietitian about other 
natural alternative methods of losing weight before contemplating on the 
use of Nuratrim.
