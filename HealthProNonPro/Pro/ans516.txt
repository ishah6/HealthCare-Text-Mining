I do understand your concern. Pregnancy is the first diagnosis that needs 
to be ruled out, but since your pregnancy tests have come back negative, I 
would suggest that you consult a gynecologist. Some causes such rapid 
weight loss, diet change, increased exercise and certain more complex 
conditions such as thyroid problems as well as ovarian conditions would 
need to be investigated. A blood test to evaluate your female hormones 
levels would be the initial step along with a detailed history and physical 
evaluation.
