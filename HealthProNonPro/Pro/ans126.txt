Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is a common skin cancer arising from the basal 
layer of epidermis. A person with history of basal cell carcinoma is at 
increased risk of subsequent lesions. There are many risk factors of basal 
cell carcinoma like chronic sun exposure, sex (men are more likely to have 
BCC), age, family history of skin cancer, immune-suppressing drugs and 
exposure to radiation. Having undergone radiation treatments for testicular 
seminoma could definitely increase your risk of basal cell carcinoma.
