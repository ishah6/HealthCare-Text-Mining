Sandhi Sudha is ayurvedic oil advertised for use in joint pain-arthritis. 
There is no serious research done about this product. The causes of ankle 
swelling are multiple and very diverse, they include: injury, infectious or 
inflammatory local processes (cellulitis/tendinitis), heart, liver and 
kidney problems, circulation disorders, Thyroid problems, Rheumatoid 
arthritis and arthrosis (degenerative bone changes) in older persons. I 
suggest that your mother have a comprehensive evaluation (clinical, lab 
test and imaging) from an Internal Medicine doctor to determine the cause 
of the ankle swelling, joint pain and from there select the appropriate 
treatment option.
