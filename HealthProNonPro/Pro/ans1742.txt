Whitish discharge form the penis is usually indicative of a sexually 
transmitted infection. The other symptoms which often accompany are burning 
on passing urine, frequent need to pass urine, rash in the genital area and 
swollen lymph nodes in the groin. It usually takes two to five days from 
infection to symptoms. Common practice suggests that people could go in for 
basic testing for bacterial STDs as soon as 2 to 3 weeks after an exposure 
- sooner if they have symptoms. If you are not sure of the results, You may 
get a repeat test done in about a months time. Tests for chlamydia and 
gonorrhea would be reasonably accurate by then.
