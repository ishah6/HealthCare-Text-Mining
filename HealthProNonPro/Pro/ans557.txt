I understand how concerned you are about your baby’s health. It is 
difficult to predict what amount of alcohol will harm your baby. If you 
drink during pregnancy there is certainly a risk for the baby to develop 
fetal alcohol syndrome. Binge drinking is especially bad for the developing 
baby.Your baby may have a range of disabilities ranging from physical, mental to 
social and mental disorders. Children with fetal alcohol syndrome may be 
small and may have learning or behavior problems.I would suggest that you see your doctor and comply with pre-natal measures 
to evaluate your baby' health. It is recommended that you take pre-natal 
vitamins, especially folic acid which is required for the development of 
the nervous system of the baby.
