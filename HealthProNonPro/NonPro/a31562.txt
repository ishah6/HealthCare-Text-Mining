I just went to the doctor with a very same problem.  She did say no hot showers it does dry up the skin, but she also said, after the shower to towel dry half way and put cephil lotion on your semi-wet skin, it absorbs the lotion better. 

I have used many different lotion for dry skin, the most impressive one was, Avon, Moisture Therapy, Silicone Glove and Aveeno moisturizer cream.  

My skin looks supple and very very different now.  I went back for follow appointment to my dermatologist and she was pretty amazed!  Try it.
