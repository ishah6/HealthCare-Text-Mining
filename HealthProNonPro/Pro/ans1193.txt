Thank you for your question. MDMA is a dangerous amphetamine type ilicit 
drug which can cause sudden cardiac arrest and death from just a single 
dose. There have been increasing reports of this throughout North America 
and the world at large. We do not recommend you using this drug on under 
any circumstance. Since you are on Warfarin, you are at increased risk of a 
fatal interaction that is unknown to the medical community due to the fact 
that MDMA has not been widely tested for its interactions with other drugs. 
Do not use MDMA.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
