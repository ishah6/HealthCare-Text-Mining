There are many conditions that may lead to the development of a lack of 
taste and metallic feel on the tongue. Any condition that effects the 
transmission of taste sensation from the tongue to the brain may cause 
these symptoms. Smoking, trauma to the mouth and nose, dry mouth, infection 
of the oral cavity, vitamin B12 and zine deficiency and certain medicines 
like antibiotics, anti-thyroid drugs cause impaired taste.You may need to consult your doctor to take a complete history and examine 
you to see for an underlying pathology that could cause your symptoms. A CT 
scan may also be done to look at the part of brain that controls smell.
