Making the decision to try for another pregnancy after miscarriage can be 
difficult. It is but natural to try to get pregnant after the terrible 
loss. There is no perfect amount of time to wait before trying to conceive 
again. Many doctors advise a gap of a few months before trying to get 
pregnant because it gives time for the uterus to recover and for the 
endometrial lining to become strong and healthy again. It may be safe to 
conceive after two or three normal menstrual periods.
