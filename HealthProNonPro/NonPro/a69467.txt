You didnt cheat accidently... sorry.  You put yourself in the situation.   You didnt plan it, it just happened.   IT was good that you were honest about it with her.  I am sorry that it didnt work out for you, but it just means that she isnt the one for you.  

what a minute?  did you say 6th time?  you have cheated on 6 girls?  you have issues kid.  Cheating is not natural.  .... Try not having a "girlfriend" for a while and that way you wont be a cheater... 

You have a lot of growing up to do.
