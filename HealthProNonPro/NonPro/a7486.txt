its easy to gain weight but its hard to lose it. If you want to gain weight, fast food will help you the most. Specially, the food with high choestorol helps the body to increase but eating foods with cholestorol isnt good for health. It may block the heart. Another way is to eat something with high calorie. Calorie isnt as bad as cholesterol.
