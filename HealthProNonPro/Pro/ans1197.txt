Thank you for your question. Now that you have noticed that you are 
required to take two doses of your antibiotic medication per day, we 
recommend that henceforth, you take 2 pills per day as prescribed by your 
doctor. Make sure you take your antibiotics until the course is completely 
finished and there are no pills remaining. This will provide you with the 
best results in treating your throat infection.
