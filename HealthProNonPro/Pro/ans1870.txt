Your weight loss and cold intolerance could be the result of anemia, poor 
diet, hypothyroidism, anorexia and chronic illness. Since you've been 
experiencing these symptoms for the past few months, I would suggest that 
you consult your doctor for further evaluation. Blood work for hemoglobin, 
thyroid levels and a chest x-ray may help in determining the cause of 
weight loss.
