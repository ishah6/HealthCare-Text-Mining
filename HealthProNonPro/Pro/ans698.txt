It is difficult for me to say what is causing your blurry vision. Trauma, 
orbital cellulitis, endopthalmitis, corneal infections and abrasions, 
uveitis, migrains may all cause blurring of vision. The next proper step in 
the management is to get your eye examined by an ophthalmologist to rule 
out the causes that I've just mentioned.
