Nurses are typically a laisaion between the other professionals and the patient.

They gather info and carry out orders of the doc and therapists, and that would probably include a nutritionist.

As info gatherers, the nurse would probably have access to a lot of info that could affect the diet of a patient. Knowing if I/Os are good (I/O means in/out, hydration and eating/elimination). Knowing if there is need for more or less fiber, supplemental shakes or vitamins, IV hydration, change in fat, sodium, cholesterol, caffeine, etc intake, if the patient can chew or chokes on their food or drink they may need it pureed or thickened.

Nurses as in RNs dont probably do much in terms of serving or feeding the patient, there are other people who can do that if needed, but well informed nurses will know whats up with the patients diet and how it fits in with the overall health of the patient and they will be responsible for communicating this to a doc, who will recommend any changes or help the nutritionist/dietician decide what is needed.
