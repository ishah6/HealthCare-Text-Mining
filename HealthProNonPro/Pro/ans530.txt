I do understand your concern. Though there is nothing such as 100% 
protection, your girlfriend would be protected against pregnancy if she 
started taking the oral contraceptives on the first day of her periods. 
Definitely taking Plan B along with oral contraceptive will cause the 
periods to be irregular. However, she may need to do a pregnancy test if 
she misses her periods to rule out pregnancy.
