The presence of a black stools may indicate bleeding from the upper 
gastrointestinal tract. The bleeding may be caused by a gastric or duodenal 
ulcer or may indicate a variceal bleed. In view of the symptoms that you 
have presented, I would advise for an urgent consultation with your 
gastroenterologist. An upper GI endoscopy may help to detect the site of 
bleed.
