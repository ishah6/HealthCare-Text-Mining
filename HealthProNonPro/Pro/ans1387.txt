The middle of the ear is connected with the back of the throat by a 
tube-like structure known as Eustachian tube. This structure helps to 
relieve the pressure of the inner ear. When you have cold, this gets 
blocked by mucus and you may feel a certain amount of ear discomfort. What 
you may have experienced by blowing the nose, is this tube opening up. 
There will be no ear damage.
