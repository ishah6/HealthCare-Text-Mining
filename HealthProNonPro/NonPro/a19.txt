A person can have primary or secondary insomnia.<br />
Primary insomnia - having sleep problems that are not directly associated with any other health condition or problem.<br />
Secondary insomnia - having sleep problems because of something else, such as a health condition (like depression, heartburn, cancer, asthma, arthritis), pain, medication they are taking, or a substance they are using (like alcohol). <br />
<br />
Insomnia can be short-term (called acute insomnia) or last a long time (called chronic insomnia).<br />
Short-term insomnia (acute insomnia)- can last from one night to a few weeks. It is often caused by emotional or physical discomfort, and can be related to a single specific event. <br />
<br />
Chronic (long-term) insomnia is when a person has insomnia at least 3 nights a week for 1 month or longer.<br />
It can be caused by many things and often occurs along with other health problems. Common causes of chronic insomnia are depression, chronic stress, and pain or discomfort at night.
