Some women think they should only have sex if they are feeling aroused. But the truth is, as she goes about  her day-to-day life, she might not think about sex all that much. So when you ask for sex, she wont be in the mood. Instead, try asking if you can snuggle, kiss, or give her a backrub. Make sure she knows that you wont have sex if she doesnt want to. After fifteen minutes of affection, you can ask if shed like to have sex. She might be more interested at that point. 

To be fair, you can also try to turn down your sex drive a bit. Try to spend a little less time thinking about sex or looking at things that make you horny. Instead, work on a hobby or spend time with your friends.
