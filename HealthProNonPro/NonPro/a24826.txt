Google your ideal caloric intake based on your age, height, and weight. There are 3500 calories in a pound. And lets say for example you need 2000 calories per day. If you cut back to 1500, then you would lose 1lb per week. If you exercise, and burn an additional 300 calories per day, then you would lose almost 2lbs per week. Forget all the fad diets. This works! I promise!
