Your insomnia could be the result of an underlying problem, therefore it 
may be essential that you consult your physician for further evaluation. 
Anxiety and depression may also lead to decreased sleep. If these have been 
ruled out you could try certain lifestyle modifications :i) Firstly, it is important to have good sleep “hygiene”. This includes: 
avoiding caffeine and nicotine, avoiding exercise 4 hours before bedtime, 
avoiding larger meals at supper, avoiding day time naps, sleeping and 
waking at the same time every day, making the bedroom as dark and as 
comfortable as possible, avoiding other activities like reading, eating or 
watching television in the bedroom.ii) Cognitive behavior therapy (CBT) is effective if there are no 
underlying medical causes of your sleep problems and this should be 
excluded by your physician. The goal of CBT is to break the cycle of 
insomnia, mental distress, negative and irrational thoughts, and further 
sleep disturbances.
