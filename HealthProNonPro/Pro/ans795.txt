It is very likely that your increased bleeding during periods could be due 
to the approaching menopause that usually occurs during this age period. 
You may notice certain irregularities in your periods during this time 
including change in timing, duration and heaviness of periods. If you 
continue to experience frequent heavy menstrual bleeds and associated 
symptoms like abdominal pain, hot flashes, emotional changes etc. contact 
your GP right away.
