At the time of the car accident most likely you sustained a muscle 
contusion. Contusions occur when a direct blow or repeated blows from a 
blunt object strike part of the body, crushing underlying muscle fibers and 
connective tissue without breaking the skin. A contusion can result from 
falling or jamming the body against a hard surface. Sometimes a pool of 
blood collects within damaged tissue, forming a lump over the injury 
(hematoma). Sometimes from the hematoma develop myositis ossificans. This 
is a condition in which the bruised muscle grows bone instead of new muscle 
cells.Symptoms may include mild to severe pain that does not go away and 
swelling at the injury site. Abnormal bone formations can also reduce your 
flexibility. Vigorous stretching exercises may make the condition 
worse.Rest, ice, compression and elevation to reduce inflammation will 
usually help. Gentle stretching exercises may improve flexibility. Surgery 
is rarely required.
