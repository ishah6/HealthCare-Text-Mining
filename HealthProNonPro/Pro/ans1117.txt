Thank you for your question. A severe peanut allergy can elicit a reaction 
by simply having the skin come in contact with peanuts. We recommend that 
you exercise the same precautions when engaging in any type of intimate 
physical contact with your partner. Be sure that your partner always has 
his epi-pen on his person and knows how to use it in case of an accidental 
exposure to peanuts. An Epi-pen is a syringe like devise that administers a 
dose of epinephrine into the body via injection into the muscle. This would 
slow the progression of a severe allergic reaction in time to be 
transported to a hospital for emergency treatment. This can be obtained via 
prescription from your partners doctor. Please be guided accordingly.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
