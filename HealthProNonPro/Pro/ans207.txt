Consulting your doctor for an X Rays are a good first step in assessment. 
The x-ray will rule out the possibility of a fracture. An ultrasound or MRI 
may be ordered to assess any soft tissue damage. The MRI is a better test 
but an ultrasound may be more readily available. The results of the 
imaging will determine if surgical repair of the soft tissue is required 
(rare) or physical therapy (more common). Wrist injuries can be amongst the 
slowest injuries to heal and may require 3-6 months to completely heal.
