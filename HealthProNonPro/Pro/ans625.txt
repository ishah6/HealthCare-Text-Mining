In most cases, there is no reason to be concerned if bleeding occurs after 
taking an emergency contraceptive pill. A common side effect of the pill 
is that it causes spotting at irregular intervals, which should go away by 
itself after the next period.If you experience that the bleeding is getting worse or you have abdominal 
pain, fever or dizziness, it may be a good idea to see your health-care 
provider for further evaluation.
