Have you been depressed for a long time?  If you have, did you cry a lot when you first became depressed?  If so, maybe youve become emotionless.  This is not an educated answer but I can relate.  I am also chronically depressed and I used to cry all the time but I think Ive run my emotions dry and the bad things just dont make me feel anything anymore.  I kinda just take it as it comes in stride.  I hope this makes sense to you.
