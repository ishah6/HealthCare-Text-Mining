It seems unlikely that you may be pregnant especially taking into 
consideration the timing of the sexual encounter. I would however advice 
you to do a home pregnancy test test just to be sure.Having unprotected sex can definitely lead to a urinary tract infection. 
Due the a short urethra in females, it is easier for infection to travel up 
into the bladder. My advice would be to avoid sex until the infection heals.
