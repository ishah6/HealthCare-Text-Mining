I think you should go with slightly lower weights, maybe eight or five pounds. I work out a lot and even when im just using 12 pound dumbells i get bulky in my arms pretty easy. Using a lower weight with more reps would help with toning without making your arms look bigger. Thats just me might be different with you. My weight usually fluctuates about five pounds but i weighed in yesterday at 128. Im 54.
