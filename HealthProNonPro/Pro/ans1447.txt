The plexiform neurofibromas tend to progress, and may extend along nerve 
roots to eventually involve the spinal roots and spinal cord. Besides from 
the obvious mechanical complications , they have a tendency, rare, to 
undergo malignant change forming malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours. 
Malignant progression may occur in 2–16% of patients and is the major cause 
of morbidity and mortality in NF1 patients.
