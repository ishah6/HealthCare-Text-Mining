Primary amenorrhea is failure of menses to start by the age of 14 years 
without signs of secondary sexual development or by the age of 16 years in 
girls with normal secondary sexual characteristics.In most cases it is commonly causes by a constitutional delay in puberty. 
However, genetic, hypothalamic, pituitary, ovarian and uterine factors may 
need to be rules out. I would suggest that you consult your doctor for 
further evaluation and tests to rule out causes of primary amenorrhea.
