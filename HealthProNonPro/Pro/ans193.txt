Citalopram is an SSRI antidepressant drug. Tapering of the drug is 
recommended due to development of discontinuation syndrome if the drug is 
suddenly stopped. The symptoms experienced are dizziness, confusion, 
tremors, nausea , vomiting, tremors and vertigo.I would suggest that you 
talk to your doctor regarding the problem of sudden withdrawal of the drug.
