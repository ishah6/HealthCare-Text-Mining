Thank you for your question. Any type of sexual contact wherein unprotected 
genitals come in contact with the genital secretions (in this case vaginal) 
of a person suspected to have HIV does pose a risk for transmitting the 
virus. Although this may be considered lower risk when compared to 
unprotected sexual intercourse. We do recommend that you ere on the side of 
caution and conduct a HIV test at your doctors office to be certain of this.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
