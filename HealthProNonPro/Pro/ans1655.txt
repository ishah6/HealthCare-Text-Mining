Treatment of acne scars depend on the severity of the scars. Usually the 
mild scars fade in 10-12 months. More severe acne scars may need 
microdermabrasion, chemical peeling to hasten the recovery process. Laser 
treatment, skin surgery and grafting are the options available for the 
removal of resistant scars. Avoid using oil based products and cleanse your 
face several times a day. A healthy diet and exercise may also help in the 
regeneration process.
