Stress and illness can cause hormonal imbalances that often leads to a 
missed period. Hormones are needed for ovulation. If the right amount of 
hormones aren't being distributed in a woman’s body, her ability to ovulate 
is slowed or even stopped altogether. During high periods of stress, a 
woman’s body secretes a hormone called cortisol which impacts ovulation and 
causes a missed period. Having a missed period due to stress is common 
among many women and you should not be overtly concerned. I would suggest 
that you relieve your stress levels by exercising, doing yoga, getting a 
massage of listening to music.
