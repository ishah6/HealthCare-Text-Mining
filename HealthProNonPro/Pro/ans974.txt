Palpitations are usually not serious and is normal entity. However, an 
abnormal heart rhythm may need further investigation. Heart palpitations 
can be caused by anxiety, fear, caffeine, nicotine or anemia. Since you've 
mentioned that these palpitation are accompanied with chest pain, I would 
suggest you to see your doctor for further evaluation. Your doctor may 
advise an ECG and ECHO to help diagnose the cause of the palpitations.
