Onglyza (saxagliptin) should not be used if you have type I diabetes, liver 
or heart problems and pancreatitis. You have also mentioned that you are on 
Januvia (sitagliptin), metformin and novalog which may increase the chance 
of a hypoglycemic attack. You may need to consult with your doctor in this 
regard. Hope the information helps, take care.
