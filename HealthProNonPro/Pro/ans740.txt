It is most probable that your condition is caused by a benign disorder. 
According to what you have told me, my most probable diagnosis would be 
that of epididymitis or a varicocele.A varicocele develops when the valves of the testicular vein are 
incompetent, which means blood delivered into your left testicle stays 
there. This probably explains why there is some heaviness on the left 
testicle. Epididymitis (inflamed epididymis) may have similar signs and 
symptoms but is usually associated with pain. I would suggest for you to 
avoid doing your own physical exam on your testicles (to minimize trauma) 
and go to a doctor to have tests done as soon as possible. A urologist 
would be the expert on this area. Tests eg. a urinalysis and testicular 
ultrasound may be helpful to diagnose the problem.
