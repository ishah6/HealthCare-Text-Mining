My guess here would be because youre not stating when starting a relationship that youre not a monogamous person. If you enter a relationship with someone and do not implicitly state youre not monogamous, the assumption in most societies (I would say Western, but Chinese, Japanese, Indian, and African societies also commonly follow this rule) is that you will be monogamous. There is a serious ethical difference between chiding someone for showing emotion and breaking an assumed vow to another person.
