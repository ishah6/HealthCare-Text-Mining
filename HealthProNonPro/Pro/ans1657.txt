Treatment of scars depend on the severity of the scars. There are various 
procedures available to help in the removal of facial scars. Procedures 
like Dermabrasion, Microdermabrasion or Chemical Peel may help in some 
cases. Severe scars may require laser treatment, skin surgery and grafting. 
You may speak with your dermatologist for evaluating your facial scars and 
recommend the right procedure for you.
