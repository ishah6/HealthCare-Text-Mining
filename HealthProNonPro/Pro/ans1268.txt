Thank you for your question. This tingling sensation may not be due a 
fungal infection or sexually transmitted infection, but may be due to a 
problem with the blood supply to your testicle. This can occur when the 
spermatic cord becomes entangled with blood vessels supplying the testicle 
resulting in testicular torsion. Now, testicular torsion is an extremely 
painful medical emergency, requiring immediate surgery. It is possible that 
your symptoms are a precursor to this medical emergency. We strongly advise 
you to follow up with your doctor to be examined for testicular torsion. 
This will require a physical exam of your testicles along with a possible 
doppler ultrasound to determine if the circulation is being obstructed in 
any way. Please see your doctor immediately.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
