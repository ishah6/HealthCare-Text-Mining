Pain in the testicles could be the result of trauma to the area, infections 
like epididymitis and orchitis, kidney stones and in rare cases testicular 
tumors. you have mentioned that you've had a twisted testicle (testicular 
tortion) before and this warrants examination by a doctor. To relieve the 
pain,you can use ice pack to the genital area, wear loose fitting 
undergarments and put a rolled up towed below the scrotum for support while 
sitting. Anti-inflammatory medication like tylenol and ibuprofen will help.
