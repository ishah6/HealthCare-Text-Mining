I do understand your concern of constipation after the use of methadon. 
During prolonged administration, other side-effects may decrease over 
several weeks; however, constipation and sweating may persist. 
Unfortunately there may not be other alternatives to treating chronic 
constipation from methadon use other than the ones that your doctor has 
already prescribed. I would definitely advise you to continue the same 
life-style regimen prescribed and refrain from taking any bulk producing 
laxatives like psyllium and methylcellusose. You will have to consult your 
doctor to further evaluate you (maybe even do a colonoscopy) since your 
constipation could be caused by a medical condition. Zelnorm (Tegaserod) 
was previously used for the management of constipation and irritable bowel 
syndrome, and has now been subsequently removed from the market due to 
concerns over possible increased risk of heart attacks and stroke. I would 
not advise you to use this drug. I hope the information helps.
