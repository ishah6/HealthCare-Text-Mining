Though you have not mentioned in which organ the cyst is present, I will 
preseume that its an ovarian cyst. There is a chance that the cyst may 
rupture on lifting weights, therefore I will advise rest and normal 
activiesties until the spotting has stopped. If you experience more than 
usual pain or bleeding becomes worse, I would suggest you to see your 
doctor as soon as possible. Hope the information helps.
