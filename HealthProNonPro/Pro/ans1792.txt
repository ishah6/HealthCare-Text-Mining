You sustained a head trauma and according to your description you might be 
experiencing the sequels of a Concussion. A concussion is a brain injury 
that may produce headache, altered levels of alertness and unconsciousness. 
Most of the time is the result of an important and significant blow to the 
head that shakes the brain inside the skull, which temporarily prevents the 
brain from working normally, this blow, may be mild, moderate or severe. 
Sometimes a person who has a more serious concussion, may develop new 
symptoms over time and feels worse than before the injury, this is “Post 
Concussive Syndrome”. It is important that over the time you start to show 
Post Concussive Symptoms, you call your doctor and get a thoroughly 
neurological evaluation. The post concussive symptoms include: difficulty 
to think, concentrate or remember; headaches or blurry vision; becoming 
angry or anxious for no reason; lack of interest in your usual activities, 
changes in your sex drive, dizziness, lightheadedness or unsteadiness that 
makes difficult for you to walk or standing. It is difficult to predict the 
outcome in terms of neurologic sequels, some people feel normal again in a 
few hours after a concussion while others have symptoms and sequels for 
weeks or months, it depends on each case in particular and also depends on 
the severity of blows. I strongly recommend you to have the follow up 
evaluation with your doctor.
