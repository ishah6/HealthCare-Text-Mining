Thank you for you question. The best way to regain your natural skin 
complexion is to avoid excessive sun exposure and wear protective sun 
screen of at least spf 30 when you will be out in the sun. We generally 
advise against using skin lightening creams as the chemicals it contains 
can be harmful to the skin, cause permanent damage and scarring, and may 
even contribute to the development of skin cancer. We recommend you refrain 
from using such creams unless prescribed by and monitored by a certified 
dermatologist. Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
