I do understand that treatment medication of depression may leave you 
feeling sedated, apathetic and in a state of numbness. However, stopping 
the treatment will only further aggravate the symptoms of depression. I 
would like you to speak with your doctor/psychiatrist and come up with a 
reasonable plan that you can adhere to.Children with depressed parents get stressed out more easily than other 
children, this is further aggravated if the parent is negative towards the 
child. Your child may also inherit your depression. This can be reversed if 
intervened early with effective parenting. You may want to consult your 
doctor on ways to reduce the stressful relationship with your child. I hope 
I am able to provide information that is useful to you, take care.
