Holy moly....I have the same problem and seriously.....I understand that it is a chronic problem and it does suck. If you figure out something to curb the problem please let me know. I go online to check my email and end up online for hours. I try to only get online certain days and end up online everyday. I mean, it takes up all of my time. I mean, look at me now....I have a million things to do and I am writing to you about it instead of doing it. I think we just need to pray for God to show us the way to do what we need to be doing when we need to be doing it. I will pray for you and you pray for me. ~Dawn
