Get your Dr. to give you a prescription for Retin-A.  Its a topical ointment that really dries up blemishes.  However, if you have already dry skin, it might be too strong.  In that case, I would go to the drug store and buy a topical product that contains salicylic acid (I like Johnson & Johnson Clean & Clear).

One other way I keep my skin clear is by making sure I hydrate - I drink boatloads of water (my aesthetician always comments on this when I go in for facials).  You might want to try splurging on a facial - ask the aesthetician about your skin type and about the kinds of products s/he would recommend you use.
