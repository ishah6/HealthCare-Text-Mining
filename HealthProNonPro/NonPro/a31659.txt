well mabey its not her, mabey its you. Do you do the same moves all the time! She probably gets bored, did you ever think of that. Gosh if my husband, ever did the same thing over and over and calls himself a sex adict, then i would be happy to buy him a Kama Sutra!!! If Im gonna hit the sheets from Sun up TO SUN UP!!! Then this dog better learn some new tricks to keep me going.
Dont be afraid to try new things, heck, she may even like it and want more of it!!!
-Good Luck!
