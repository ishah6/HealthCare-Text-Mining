Most likely during the microdiscectomy some terminal root nerves that 
supply sensation to the area were touched, also the local irritation and 
swelling by the procedure might be producing the symptoms. The results of 
microdiscectomy surgery in the treatment of a painful, herniated disc are 
generally excellent. Numerous research studies in medical journals 
demonstrate greater than 90-96% good or excellent results from 
microdiscectomy surgery. Most patients are noted to have a rapid 
improvement of their pain and return to normal function. Before to go home, 
physical therapists and occupational therapists work have to with you and 
instruct you on proper techniques of getting in and out of bed and walking 
independently. Also to avoid bending at the waist, lifting (more than five 
pounds), and twisting in the early postoperative period (first 2-4 weeks) 
to avoid a strain injury or recurrent disc injury. You should try to avoid 
sitting in the same position for more than 45-60 minutes in the first few 
weeks after surgery. After sitting for 45-60 minutes, you should get up and 
stretch or walk for a little bit, then sit down again if desired. If after 
follow to the letter all these recommendations, you are still in pain, I 
strongly suggest that you discuss with your doctor about the worsening of 
the pain and a revaluation of your case.
