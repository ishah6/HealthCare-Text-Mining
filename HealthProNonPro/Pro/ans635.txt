In small amounts, sodium nitrite isn't toxic, though it can form compounds 
that are highly dangerous through chemical reactions in the body. In large 
quantities, however, the salt itself may be harmful. It irritates mucous 
membranes and can lead to rapid heart rate and rapid breathing, as well as 
seizures, coma, and death. Excess contact with skin and eyes causes 
redness, itching and swelling.
