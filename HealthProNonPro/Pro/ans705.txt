It is difficult for me to tell the cause of your persistent pulmonary 
infiltrates. These infiltrate may be due to pus, edema, blood, protein or 
cells that linger within the lung parenchyma after non resolving or slowly 
resolving pneumonias. Factors like age, comorbid illness (COPD, heart 
disease, diabetes), smoking, immunosuppresive states and malnutrition may 
cause persistent pulmonary infiltrates. However, since you have responded 
with more than 50% clearing of chest as per radiographic findings, I would 
call that a good clinical response.
