The nasal discharge that you are experiencing could be due to an infected 
and clogged sinus. Other causes could be due to bacterial infections, nasal 
allergy, chronic use of nasal sprays and flu. I would advise that you drink 
extra fluids, use nasal sprays and iincrease the humidity in the air with a 
vaporizer or humidifier. Antihistamines may be taken to reduce the amount 
of mucous.
