Bleeding that lasts for weeks at a time is also considered abnormal. The 
most common causes of irregular bleeding include stress, thyroid disorder, 
iron deficiency, vitamin B12 deficiency, pituitary disorders and hormone 
imbalances. All of these, except for stress can be tested via simple blood 
work. In order to rule out the exact cause of your irregular bleeding, you 
will need to have a more detailed history and evaluation preferably done by 
a gynecologist.
