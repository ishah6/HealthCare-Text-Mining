In medical terms, ringing in the ear is known as tinnitus. Tinnitus can 
occur in any of the 4 sections of the ear (outer, middle, inner and part of 
the brain). Tinnitus is often accompanied by hearing loss but not always as 
in your case. Without an actual examination in person diagnosing what you 
have is very difficult. You are lucky there is no flow of fluids in your 
ear. My recommendation would be to see if you can get your appointment with 
ENT specialist moved up. You will have to undego a auditory assessment and 
might be sent for CT or MRI scan of the head to see if the source of the 
noise can be traced. Good luck and once again try and see if you can get 
that appointment moved up.
