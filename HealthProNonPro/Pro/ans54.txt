According to your description, a cervical nerve compression must be ruled 
out in your case also an inflammation of the peripheral nerves at the level 
of the arm and hand, for example a Carpal Tunnel Syndrome. In the younger 
patients, cervical radiculopathy may be a result of a disc herniation or an 
acute injury causing impingement of an exiting nerve. In the older patient, 
cervical radiculopathy is often a result of spinal canal narrowing from 
bone (osteophyte) formation, decreased disc height and degenerative changes 
due to aging process. The treatment strategy usually includes: physical 
therapy program aimed to reduce pain and inflammation, and the use of 
anti-inflammatory drugs (as “motrin”, “advil”),TENS, also a re-education of 
habits and posture to improve quality of life. You should be independent in 
a stretching and strengthening program and continue with these exercises 
under the periodic supervision of a physical therapist initially and then 
completely on your own. Patients whose condition fails to improve with a 
comprehensive rehabilitation program and selective injections (medrol dose 
kit) should be presented with a surgical reevaluation. Often, patients 
should show progressive improvement over the first 6-8 weeks with 
conservative treatment.
