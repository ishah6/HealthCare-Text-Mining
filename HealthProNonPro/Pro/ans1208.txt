Thank you for your question. Running actually exercises the muscles of the 
calves a lot and this can actually increase the size of your calves versus 
reducing the size of them. In order to reduce the size of your calves we 
recommend avoiding exercises that over work the calf muscles. We recommend 
that you alter your exercise routine buy engaging in actives such as 
swimming, using an elliptical trainer, or yoga/pilates which exercises the 
entire body without focusing on a single particular area. This, over a 
gradual period of time will proportionately reduce the size of your calves 
but maintain your physical fitness. Please consult your doctor before 
starting any new exercise routine.Thank you fro choosing AskTheDoctor.com
