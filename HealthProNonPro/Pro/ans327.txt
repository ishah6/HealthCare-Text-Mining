Ganglion cysts are the most common soft-tissue benign tumors of the hand 
and wrist. These are most probably caused due to irritation of the 
articular tissue leading to the out-pouching of the synovium. They commonly 
are seen in the dorsum of the wrist and at the distal interphalangeal 
joints. Arthroscopic removal of the cyst is the treatment of choice. 
Recurrence is a common problem but may be reduced if the capsule is removed 
during the surgery.A high intensity focused ultrasound treatment is used for the treatment for 
fibroids and prostate cancer and may not be effective in treatment of 
ganglion cysts. Regardless of which treatment you may take, recurrence is a 
possibility the cause of which is still unclear.
