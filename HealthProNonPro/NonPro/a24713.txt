First of all you would have to find out the cause of the yellowish tint. Often activities such as smoking and coffee drinking leave stains on your teeth that stay there permanently even with brushing. Another cause is a lack of teeth brushing which dentists reccoment at least twice daily or best after every meal or flossing. To solve such a problem, you will have to see a dentist to clean out the stain or plaque, often through scalling. The dentist will use a drill and scrape off the outer plaque layer until the teeth is white again. it is also recommended that this be done every six month when needed as with the normal schedule for a dentist visit yearly.
