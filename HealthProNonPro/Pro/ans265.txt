Endometrial polyps are outgrowths of the endocervical mucosa. These are 
generally benign and are the commonly seen in the fourth to sixth decade. 
Though most of these polyps may be asymptomatic, postcoital bleeding and 
leukorrhea may be present in some cases.Routine hysteroscopic resection and histopathologic analysis of endometrial 
polyps is appropriate, whether or not the polyps are associated with 
abnormal uterine bleeding.
