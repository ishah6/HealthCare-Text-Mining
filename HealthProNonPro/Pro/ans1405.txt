The most probable cause of breast lumps and tenderness in your case would 
be due to fibrocystic breast changes. These breast changes are normal and 
harmless. Women with fibocystic breast changes have breasts that feel 
lumpy, thick, and tender, especially right before their periods.Your missed periods may not be related to the breast changes unless if you 
are pregnant. I would recommend that you see your doctor for a breast 
examination and further evaluation for the delayed periods. Usually taking 
an over the counter pain medication like tylenol or advil may help relieve 
the symptoms of pain in a case of fibrocystic breast change.
