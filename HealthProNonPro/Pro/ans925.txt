Nausea, vomiting and metallic taste in the mouth are common side effects of 
metronidazole. Unfortunately there is no remedy to counteract these 
symptoms. The nausea and vomiting should disappear on its own as the body 
gets used to the drug. If you experience severe symptoms, I would suggest 
that you talk to your physician for an alternative treatment.
