The cause of your abdominal pain could be due to "Mittelschmerz". This is a 
one-sided, lower abdominal pain that occurs in women at or around the time 
of ovulation - about 14 days before the next menstrual period.Most cases do not require any medical treatment. Over the counter pain 
medications may be used if pain is severe. There are usually no 
complications of Mittelschmerz.
