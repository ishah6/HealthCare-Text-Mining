Though there may be a chance that you are pregnant, they are minimal. To be 
sure you may take a home pregnancy test or see your doctor for a blood 
pregnancy test for more accurate results and confirmation. However lighter 
periods than the usual may also occur with some other reasons like stress, 
anemia, improper diet, extreme exercise, weight loss etc.
