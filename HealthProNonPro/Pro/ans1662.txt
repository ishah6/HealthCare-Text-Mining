Typically in a young adult the cause of chest and upper back pain could be 
the result of an musculo-skeletal strain or respiratory tract infection. 
However, it is important to rule out chest pain caused by a heart 
condition. I would advise you to see your physician for an 
electrocardiogram and chest x-ray to determine the cause of pain. I hope 
this helps.
