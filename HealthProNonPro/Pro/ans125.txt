Back pain is usually benign and mainly caused by mechanical stress and 
strain. Usually problems with the disc are a result of herniation and 
compression of nerve roots. The cause of disc herniation is due to trauma 
or injury, degenerative changes with age, lifting heavy weighs or forceful 
twisting of the lower back. The treatment of the lumbar herniated disc is 
by rest, pain-killers and physical therapy. Ice, ultrasound treatment to 
the muscles, massage and transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) 
may help in some cases. Severe cases of back pain may require 
corticosteroid injections and surgery.
