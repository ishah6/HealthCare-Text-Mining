Autism is a developmental disorder that affects the child's normal brain 
development and causes problems with social and communication skills. The 
causes of autism are not known, though genetic factors seem to be important.It is usually parents who notice the first signs of autism. Signs of autism 
typically appear before 3 years of age, and sometimes it can be detected as 
early as 18 months. But because autism symptoms vary greatly, two children 
with the same diagnosis may act quite differently and have strikingly 
different skills. Problems with social skills can include : lack of eye 
contact, failure to respond when the child is called by name, preferring to 
play alone, lack of expression of feelings and unable to interpret facial 
expressions and gestures and resistance to being held or cuddles.The child may also show signs of repetitive movements such as rocking, 
flaping of hands and spinning movements. A child with autism might become 
obsessed with an object and are prone to tantrums. Children with autism may 
also experience with speech and language. They may start talking later than 
other children, or speak with an abnormal rhythm or voice. A detailed 
evaluation is always done first to confirm the diagnosis.
