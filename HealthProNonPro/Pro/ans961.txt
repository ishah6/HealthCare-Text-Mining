Pain in the lower left abdomen could be due to many causes and it will be 
difficult for me to point out a single cause of your pain. Since you work 
out Bike and Eliptical Machines, my probable diagnosis would be a 
musculo-skeletal strain. If your pain does not subside with over the 
counter pain medications, I would advise you to see your doctor for other 
causes such as kidney or urinary infection, diverticular disease or 
inguinal hernia.
