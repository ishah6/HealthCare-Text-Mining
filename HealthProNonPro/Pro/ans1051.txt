Severe pain experiencied during periods that limit normal activities could 
be a sign of dysmenorrhea. Primary dymenorrhea may present with pain in the 
presence of normal pelvic organs whereas there is an underlying pelvic 
pathology present in secondary dysmenorrhea.The most common causes of secondary dysmenorrhea are endometriosis, pelvic 
inflammatory disease, ovarian cyst, uterine polyps and adhesions. I would 
advise you to see her doctor for a complete physical examination and tests.
