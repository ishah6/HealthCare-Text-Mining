Depending on the severity of the injury, it may take several months for the 
elbow to be completely back to normal. Early mobilization and stretching 
exercises of the elbow will help in increasing the range of motion of the 
elbow. If the range of movements do not improve, aggressive physical 
therapy may be needed to improve the range of motion of the joint.
