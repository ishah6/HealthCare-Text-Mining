It is common to experience some amount of bleeding after a Pap smear as a 
result of injury to the cervical lining due to the procedure. However this 
bleeding should be light, mostly experienced as spotting and should resolve 
on its own. There is a possibility that during intercourse the cervix could 
have been irritated leading to the bleeding. I would suggest that you 
refrain from sexual intercourse for a week till the cervix heals 
completely. If the bleeding continue or gets worse, I would suggest that 
you see your doctor for an examination.
