I do understand your concern. It sometimes takes 8-10 cycles of clomid 
before ovulation occurs. I would advise you to be patient and continue with 
the treatment in accordance with your doctor.It may be difficult for me to say whether you are pregnant or not. A home 
pregnancy test is fairly accurate if done on the date of a missed period, 
however you may want to do a serum pregnancy test which is more accurate. I 
would advise you to consult your doctor for further management.
