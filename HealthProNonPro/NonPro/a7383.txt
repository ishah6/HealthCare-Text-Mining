I feel that it is not that we need to but feel like we must,for example you have just stolen somthing and are caught you are asked if you have done somthing wrong you will most likely say no. This is because of guilt and the fear that somthing bad will happen if the truth is found. Like Santa Clause it is not that parents like lying to children but to give children the feel of magic in their hearts and to have somthing to belive in.So you see lying is not always bad.If you do not like my response I cant say I blame you, Im only 12 after all.
