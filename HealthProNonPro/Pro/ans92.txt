Amoxicillin is a penicillin antibiotic whereas cefixime is in a group of 
drugs called cephalosporin. Both drugs tend to be used to treat the same 
type of organisms in conditions such as sinus infections, ear infections 
and some skin infections. I see no reason why you should be taking these 
two antibiotics at the same time. I would advise that you continue with 
cefixime and switch over to amoxicillin if your dental problem aggravates.
