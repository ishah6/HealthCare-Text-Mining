There is no treatment for herpes and that is why your doctor did not give 
you any medication for it. Genital herpes is usually caused by HSV 2 though 
HSV 1 may also present in some cases. Antivirals may be helpful if you have 
an active disease to reduce the symptoms. Condoms remain the best way to 
protect against catching genital herpes. Using a condom regularly will help 
prevent the spread of the disease.
