Your chronic headaches could be due a post concussion syndrome or the 
hydrocephalus itself. It is important for you to consult your 
doctor/neurologist to rule out any underlying complication. Post-concussion 
syndrome may present with headaches and dizziness and may last for weeks 
and sometimes months after the injury that caused the concussion. It is 
also not uncommon for people with hydrocephalus to experience headaches. 
Headaches in hydrocephalus may be due to intermittent proximal shunt 
obstruction, low shunt pressure and associated migraine.
