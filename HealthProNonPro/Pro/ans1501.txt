The symptoms that you have mentioned, weight fluctuations, facial hair and 
irregular periods all suggest of polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS). This 
is caused by an imbalance in the female sex hormones. PCOS occurs in 5 - 
10% of women and is the commonest cause of infertility.The diagnosis of PCOS is made on the basis of clinical signs and symptoms. 
Your doctor may also have to rule out other illnesses that have similar 
features such as hypothyroidism and hyperprolactinemia.Treatment will involve losing weight, birth control pills to regulate the 
menstrual cycle and metformin to increase the body's sensitivity to 
insulin. In certain cases, treatment with clomiphen citrate may be needed 
to stimulate ovulation. You may have to discuss treatment options with your 
doctor.
