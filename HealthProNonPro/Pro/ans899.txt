Most likely you are experiencing a De Quervain tenosynovitis. This common 
condition is caused by inflammation of the tendons in the first dorsal 
compartment of the wrist. The tendons involved are abductor and extensor 
of the thumb. Repetitive radial and ulnar deviation of the wrist, 
associated with flexion of the thumb, causes thickening of the tendon 
sheath and pain when the inflamed tendons cross the distal end of the 
radius bone of the wrist. Patients with occupations that involve repetitive 
gripping and grasping with the thumb or pastimes such as racquet sports, 
golf, or disc throwing are the most susceptible to develop this condition. 
Conservative treatment for this condition includes rest, ice, stretching 
and strengthening exercises, non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
(“motrin”, “aleve”), and immobilization of the thumb. If these measures 
fail, studies have proven the efficacy of local steroid injections in 
treating the condition. However, if symptoms recur or do not resolve after 
2 injections, surgical consultation is indicated. Surgery involves 
decompressing the first dorsal compartment by making an incision through 
the tendon sheath.
