Herpes zoster, also called shingles, is a reactivation of the 
varicella-zoster virus (VZV) that causes chickenpox. The varicella-zoster 
virus lies dormant in the spinal nerve roots or ganglion until a decrease 
in cellular immunity triggers the reactivation of the virus, resulting in 
herpes zoster.The infection presents with pain the precedes the rash. The pain may be 
described as a burning, throbbing or stabbing pain, the involved area may 
be tender to touch. The distribution of skin lesions typically occurs in an 
area controlled by a single spinal nerve (dermatome). Lymph nodes sometimes 
swell. Depending upon the area affected, there may be vision abnormalities, 
taste abnormalities, a drooping eyelid, hearing loss or joint pain.Tests rarely are done to diagnose herpes zoster but may include a viral 
culture of the skin lesion or a microscopic examination of skin cells 
(Tzanck test). Herpes zoster usually is self-limiting and is treated 
symptomatically. No drug can eliminate the virus, but antiviral drugs may 
shorten the duration of the disease, especially in immunocompromised 
individuals. Analgesics such as aspirin or narcotics in severe cases also 
can be used to reduce moderate pain associated with the disease. 
Antidepressants are used for individuals with prolonged, severe pain and 
suicidal thoughts. I would advise you to consult your doctor for further 
management.
