Any breast lump needs to be evaluated by your doctor, though the likelihood 
of the lump being cancerous is minimal. The causes of painful breast lump 
are : infections or abscesses, breast injury, benign breast lumps or 
fibroadenomas and breast cysts. I would suggest that you see your doctor 
for a breast examination and test to rule out the above mentioned causes of 
painful breast lump.
