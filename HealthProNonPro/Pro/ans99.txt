An infection by the parasite, Entamoeba histolytica, can cause 
inflammation of the intestine. A person with extraintestinal amebiasis has 
infection by this parasite in tissues outside the intestines. The liver is 
the most common location for the infection. Transmission occurs by 
ingesting cysts in contaminated food or water, or by person-to-person 
contact. Symptoms of liver infection from extraintestinal amebiasis include 
right upper abdominal pain, fever, chills, jaundice, and loss of appetite, 
fatigue, sweating, and weight loss. Symptoms of lung and chest infection 
from extraintestinal amebiasis include productive cough, chest pain, chest 
congestion, and difficulty breathing. If your pain was part of the symptoms 
for liver or lung, meaning radiated from those organs affected by the 
amebiasis, maybe that would be a possibility to consider.
