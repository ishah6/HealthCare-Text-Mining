You may be experiencing bleeding due to menopausal transition (a period 
before menopause). During the menopausal transition, normal hormonal 
cycling begins to change and ovulation may be inconsistent. These hormonal 
changes can cause the endometrium to grow and produce excess tissue, 
increasing the chances that polyps or endometrial hyperplasia (thickened 
lining of the uterus) and cause abnormal bleeding.I would however advise you to consult with your gynecologist to rule out 
other causes of bleeding like atrophic vaginitis, polyps, endometrial 
hyperplasia, infections and endometrial cancer. History and a complete 
physical examination and lab tests may help to determine the cause. An 
endometrial biopsy is often performed in women over age 35 to rule out 
endometrial cancer or abnormal endometrial growths.
