Hydrocodone narcotic drug used to relieve pain. Hydrocodone is available in 
combination of hydrocodone and acetaminophen. It is difficult for me to 
comment about the interaction of hydrocodone with 5 hour energy extra 
strength. Hydrocodone must be used with caution. The side effects of the 
drug are allergic reaction /hives leading to difficult in breathing, 
decreased respiratory rate and slow heartbeat, seizures, nausea, vomiting 
and jaundice.
