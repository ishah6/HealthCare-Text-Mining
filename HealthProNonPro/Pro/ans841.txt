Many over the counter medication and herbal supplements contain anabolic 
steroids that increase the testosterone level in the body. You have not 
stated the reason for you taking testosterone shots. You may have to weigh 
the benefits and the risks of taking these supplements. I would recommend 
natural methods of increasing testosterone levels such as weight lifting 
exercises, avoiding alcohol and smoking, de-stress and getting adequate 
amount of sleep.
