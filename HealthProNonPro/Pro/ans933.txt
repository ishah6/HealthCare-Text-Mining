Normal levels of testosterone range in between 12-40 pg/mL which varies 
slightly in different labs. Decreased testosterone may lead to low energy, 
muscle wasting, erectile dysfunction, reduced bone mass and decreased mood. 
Treatment will depend on the cause, usually testosterone replacement 
therapy (TRT) via injection, oral tablets, patch, gum or gel may be 
required if problem persists. If a pituitary problem is the cause, 
pituitary hormones may stimulate sperm production and restore fertility. 
Testosterone replacement therapy can be used if fertility isn't an issue.
