Im thinking the reason he keeps going limp is becuase of the alcohol hes been drinking. So none of this is your fault and from what you were saying, I dont think he is cheating on you. If he didnt drink so much, he would be able to sustain his erection. So next time you guys fool around tell him "no alcohol"
