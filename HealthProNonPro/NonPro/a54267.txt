what the spaghetti man said is very WRONG!!! ur body needs all sorts of nutrients and u get that by eating form each part of the pyrimad. (but lay low on the fat ) i ahve a trainer and what we did is make a food log and write down all the things we eat during the day. i suggest going to ur local gym and talking to  trainer. if its too expensive im sure they will help u in some way. jsut eat right, excersize and make sure u are not sitting around eating cookies. stay active that is the key!!!! good luck!!! have a nie day : )
