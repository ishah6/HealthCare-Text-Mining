This should be judged by body weight, and also by the amount of physical exercise done. Sugars are found in many foods, either naturally or by addition and hidden under various chemical names, as dextrose, maltose, levulose, etc. A teaspoon of sugar is about 18 calories, and generally as most people dont use more than 1,500 to 1,800 calories, with fats and carbohydrates (foods containing starches and sugars), a high intake will add to body weight as fat....its easy to gain weight but hard to lose weight....so I would suggest only a small amounts. High sugar intake can also be associated with urinary infections, various skin problems, digestive disorders, and even diarrhea. Some people claim that refined sugars (white) sugars are dangerous, but this is a fallacy as the refining is simply a means to make a better looking product rather than the crude look of brown sugar. When we speak of sugars, remember that fruit sugars and honey are part of this group.
