This is a MRI finding corresponding to uncommon lesions that are usually 
incidental but may produce symptoms. PACs represent a protrusion of 
meninges ( membranes that cover the brain)and spinal fluid from a portion 
of the skull called Meckel’s cave into another portion called petrous apex 
(small area in the skull base). Usually they do not produce symptoms but in 
the case that they do then surgical intervention must be required.
