Semen analysis studies test the semen for fluid coagulation and 
liquefaction, acidity, sperm movement or motility, volume and number and 
structure of the sperm. The normal volume varies from 1.5 to 5.0 milliliter 
per ejaculation. The sperm count varies from 20 to 150 million sperm per 
milliliter and at least 60% of the sperm should have a normal shape and 
show normal forward movement for the sperm to be called normal.
