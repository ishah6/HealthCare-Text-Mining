Even though contraceptive pills are very effective in preventing pregnancy, 
there is no such thing as 100% protection. I would definitely advise that 
you do a home pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy. A blood test for 
pregnancy can also be done which is more accurate and can detect pregnancy 
earlier.
