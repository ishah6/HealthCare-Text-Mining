Pregnancy tests are fairly accurate. However, the best time to take them is 
after a week or more of a missed period. The test measures the level of 
beta hcg in the urine to give you a positive or negative response. You may 
even consult your doctor for a blood test for pregnancy if the urine test 
is negative as it is more accurate and can detect pregnancy earlier. All 
the best.
