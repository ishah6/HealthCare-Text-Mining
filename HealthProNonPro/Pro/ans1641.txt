Though your symptoms of palpitation, shortness of breath, dizziness could 
indicate hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, your will require further evaluation 
by your doctor for a proper diagnosis. Chest x-ray may not provide much 
information and diagnosis is usually made by a thorough history and 
clinical examination, echo-cardiogram, ECG and cardiac MRI if needed. Talk 
to your doctor if your symptoms are recurrent. Hope this helps.
