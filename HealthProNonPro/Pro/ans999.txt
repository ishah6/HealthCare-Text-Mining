Postponing periods is a tricky affair and most doctors will advice you to 
keep menstruation free and unhampered. However, there are certain 
situations when one will find an extreme need to postpone it. You may ask 
your doctor for a prescription of Norethisterone, which is a progestogen 
hormone in tablet form. The tablet is taken three times a day for three 
days before your period is due and then for duration of your holiday to 
delay the period. At the end of this time, the tablets are stopped and your 
period starts as normal.
