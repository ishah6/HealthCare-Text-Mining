Possibly you are experiencing episodes of Hip bursitis, which is an 
inflammation of the hip bursa caused by repetitive use, trauma, infection, 
or systemic inflammatory disease; in your case maybe the effort of long and 
hard walks might be causing the pain. Bursae are flattened sacs that serve 
as a protective buffer between bones and overlapping muscles (deep bursae) 
or between bones and tendons/skin (superficial bursae). These 
synovial-lined sacs are filled with minimal amounts of fluid to facilitate 
movement during muscle contraction. Deep bursae, such as the subacromial 
(shoulder) and iliopsoas (hip) bursae, are located in the fascia. Symptoms 
of bursitis may or not include localized tenderness, swelling, redness, 
and/or reduced /limited movement. Most likely the treatment for bursitis 
conservative and aimed to reduce inflammation and of course the pain. 
Conservative treatment includes rest, local cold and heat treatments, 
elevation, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medication (“Motrin”, “Aleve”), 
if needed :bursal aspiration, and intrabursal steroid injections (with or 
without local anesthetic agents).
