carried by reduvid bugs and is not spread through feces and saliva. The 
risk factor for acquiring chagas disease is living is crowded conditions 
and blood transfusion. It may take upto 20 years for complications of heart 
and digestive systems. A PCR test will be able to identify the strain of 
the parasite. Hope this answers your question, take care.
