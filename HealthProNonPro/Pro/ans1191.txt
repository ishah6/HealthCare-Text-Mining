Thank you for your question. Lipitor (Atorvostatin) can cause muscle break 
down and muscle aches which can mimic the symptoms of Tendonitis. Your 
elbow pain may or may not be related to your long term lipitor use and we 
recommend that you follow up with your doctor to make sure you are not 
experiencing side effects from your cholesterol medication or you could be 
developing a problem with your elbow joints due to an degenerative joint 
disease such as arthritis. Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
