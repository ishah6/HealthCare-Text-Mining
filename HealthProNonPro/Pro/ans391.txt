I am sorry that you've been carrying this traumatic experience since 
childhood. A genital examination is performed when specifically indicated, 
such as during the periodic health exam to check for normal development of 
the external genitalia, to look for endocrine anomalies or if there is 
evidence of urogenital infection. Usually such examinations are done in the 
presence of a nurse or parent. If proper precautions are taken 
and physicians convey respect to young patients and gain their confidence, 
genital examination is a less threatening, less traumatic experience. I 
wish you well, take care.
