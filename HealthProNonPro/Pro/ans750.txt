It is not likely that the symptoms that you described correspond with a 
typical MS. Most likely seems to be an Anxiety disorder. Anxiety is a 
normal human emotion that everyone experiences at times. Many people feel 
anxious, or nervous, when faced with a problem at work, before taking a 
test, or making an important decision. Anxiety disorders, however, are 
different. They can cause such distress that it interferes with a person's 
ability to lead a normal life. For people with anxiety disorders, worry and 
fear are constant and overwhelming, and can be crippling, and even simulate 
some serious pathologies. In the view that you have been evaluated multiple 
times and the tests results have come out normal, no physical illness have 
been found, you may be referred to a psychiatrist or psychologist, mental 
health professionals who are specially trained to diagnose and treat mental 
illnesses. Psychiatrists and psychologists use specially designed interview 
and assessment tools to evaluate a person for an anxiety disorder. Although 
the exact treatment approach depends on the type of disorder, one or a 
combination of the following therapies may be used for most anxiety 
disorders: medication (anti-depressants and anxiety-reducing drugs), 
Psychotherapy ( is a process in which trained mental health professionals 
help people by talking through strategies for understanding and dealing 
with their disorder), relaxation therapy, dietary and lifestyle changes.
