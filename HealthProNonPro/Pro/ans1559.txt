There are two types of blood test for detecting pregnancy and the accuracy 
depends on the type of test done. A quantitative blood test (or the beta 
hCG test) measures the exact amount of hCG in your blood. So it can find 
even tiny amounts of hCG. This makes it very accurate. A qualitative hCG 
blood test just checks to see if the pregnancy hormone is present or not. 
So this test gives a yes or no answer. The qualitative hCG blood test is 
about as accurate as a urine test.
