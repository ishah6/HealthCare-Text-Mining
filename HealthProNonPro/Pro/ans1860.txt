Your symptoms of prolonged bleeding could be due to menorrhagia. In most 
cases the cause is unknown but may also be due to hormonal imbalance, 
during which there is excessive shedding of the endometrium. Polyps, 
endometriosis, ovarian cysts and anovulation may cause similar symptoms.You may require a more detailed work-up to determine the cause. A complete 
blood count, ultrasound of the pelvis and thyroid levels may be required to 
determine the cause. I wish you well, take care.
