I do understand your concern, your symptoms may be due to SSRI withdrawal 
syndrome that presents with various neurological symptoms that may include 
headache, gastrointestinal distress, faintness and strange sensations of 
vision or touch. Discontinuation symptoms typically arise within days after 
stopping the medication, particularly if it was stopped abruptly. I would 
suggest that you do not stop taking celexa on your own and talk to your 
doctor regarding the symptoms of SSRI withdrawal.
