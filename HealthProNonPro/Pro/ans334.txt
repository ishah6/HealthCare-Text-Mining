Genital warts are caused by the human papillomavirus (HPV). They can appear 
on the skin anywhere in the genital area as white or flesh-coloured, 
smooth, small bumps, or larger, fleshy, cauliflower-like lumps. There is no 
treatment that can completely eliminate genital warts, so unfortunately 
glacial acetic acid and 35% hydrogen peroxide will probably not work. A 
doctor can give patients various treatments to clear genital warts, but 
they may reappear even after treatment. The treatment of genital warts 
include podofilox lotion or gel, electrocautery, cryotherapy, 
electrocautery and surgical excision.
