You are most probably suffering from balanitis. This is caused due to poor 
hygiene and overlying inflammation and irritation to the penile skin. This 
causes a problem with foreskin retraction. The foreskin of the penis may be 
painful to retract and there may also be discharge and redness in the area. 
The treatment of balanitis is by topical antibiotics and proper cleaning of 
the area. If there is scarring of the foreskin, steroid creams may be 
helpful.
