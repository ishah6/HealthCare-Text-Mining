Bluish discoloration of the lower arms and limbs could be due to peripheral 
cyanosis. This may be due to high levels of deoxygenated blood, or blood 
that is not oxygen rich. I could be caused by a vascular occlusion or 
problems with decreased oxygen in the blood supply with respiratory and 
cardiac diseases. I would advise you to seek the help of your health-care 
provider for further management.
