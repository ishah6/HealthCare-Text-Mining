I do not think that your symptoms are caused due to an ectopic pregnancy 
since your pregnancy test was negative. However your symptoms may be due to 
PID, ovarian cyst, appendicitis, endometiosis or kidney stones depending on 
the site of pain which you have not mentioned. I would advise you to see 
your doctor for an internal examination and an ultrasound to determine the 
cause of the pain.
