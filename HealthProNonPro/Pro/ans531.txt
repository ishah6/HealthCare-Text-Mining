I do understand your concern. Unprotected sex could put you at a risk of 
sexually transmitted infections. However, in my opinion , the cause of your 
abdominal cramps could be due to bladder cystitis. I would advise that you 
increase your fluid intake to relieve your symptoms. If your symptoms 
worsen, see your doctor for a urinalysis. Antibiotics may be required in 
the presence of infection.
