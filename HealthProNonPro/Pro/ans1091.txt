Swelling of the feet may signify a poor urinary clearance due to diabetic 
nephropathy or cardiac insufficiency due to hypertension. I would advise 
you to consult your doctor for a complete physical examination and 
blood-work like complete blood count, kidney function tests, blood glucose, 
electrocardiogram, chest x-ray and and ECHO. Treatment will depend on the 
cause of the fluid retention.
