I do understand your concern. It is not uncommon for lymph nodes in the 
neck to become swollen when there is an infection in the airways. However 
you may require an examination by your doctor to rule out mumps. You might 
need to apply warm compresses and take over the counter anti inflammatory 
medication if your symptoms worsen.
