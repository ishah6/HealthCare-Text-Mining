Treatment of breast cancer becomes difficult when it metastases to other 
organs in the body. Although metastatic breast cancer is unlikely to be 
cured, meaningful improvements in survival have been seen, coincident with 
the introduction of newer systemic therapies. The selection of a 
therapeutic strategy depends upon both tumor biology and clinical factors, 
with the goal being a tailored approach. Most patients with metastatic 
breast cancer receive systemic medical therapy, consisting of chemotherapy, 
endocrine therapy, and/or biologic therapies, and supportive care measures.
