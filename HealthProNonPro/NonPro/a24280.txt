hi there ,, this is what i could bring to u about fibromyalgia ,,,,, hope its useful 

Fibromyalgia is a chronic disorder that causes widespread pain and tenderness in the muscles and soft tissue ,,,

symptoms of fibromyalgia :

Most people with fibromyalgia endure cycles of muscle, soft tissue, and back or neck pain, 
sleep problems, and 
often debilitating fatigue. 
Fibromyalgia is also characterized by the presence of up to 18 specific tender points on the bodyâ€”these are painful only when you press directly on them.

Although less common than pain, fatigue, and sleep problems, a variety of other symptoms may occur as well. These include headaches, morning stiffness, difficulty concentrating, a circulatory problem that affects the small blood vessels of the skin (Raynauds phenomenon), and irritable bowel syndrome. As with many conditions that cause chronic pain, anxiety and depression are common in people with fibromyalgia and may make symptoms worse.

Symptoms tend to come and go. Periods when they are constant (flares) may be followed by periods when they are absent (remissions). Some people find that cold, damp weather, emotional stress, overexertion, and other factors make their symptoms worse
