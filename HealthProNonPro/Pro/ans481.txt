I do understand your concern, unfortunately there is no way that you can 
get pregnant after removal of the uterus. However, if your ovaries are 
still intact, the eggs can then be removed, fertilized outside the body, 
and a surrogate can then become pregnant and carry your baby. You will not 
have monthly periods after uterus removal. I wish you well, take care.
