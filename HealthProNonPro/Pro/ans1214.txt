Thank you for your question. Since your child's constipation has not 
improved with prescription laxatives and suppositories it would be best to 
return to your pediatrician for further evaluation. Causes of constipation 
in babies could be due to reactions to their formula, dehydration, or an 
underlying illness such as a gastrointestinal infection, or hormonal 
fluctuations such as in hypothyroidism. Please take your child to be 
thoroughly examined by a pediatrician to determine the cause of his 
constipation. Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
