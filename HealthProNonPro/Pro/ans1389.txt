The most common cause of a groin itch is due to tinea cruris, a fungal 
infection. The infection occurs due to the prolonged wetness in the groin 
areas due to sweating and the friction from the clothes. The effected area 
may appear red, scaly with itching. An anti-fungal cream with 
hydrocortisone (a steroid) will treat the infection and reduce the symptoms 
of itching.
