Mirena is a contraceptive device that contains levonorgestrel. The 
levonorgestrel released from Mirena prevents pregnancy by increasing the 
thickness of the natural mucus at the neck of the womb. This makes it more 
difficult for sperm to cross from the vagina into the womb.It usually takes 4-6 months after the removal of the mirena coil for the 
periods to return back to normal. If you still are experiencing irregular 
periods, I would suggest that you consult your doctor for further 
evaluation.
