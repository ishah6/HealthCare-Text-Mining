The burning sensation could be due to reflux of acid contents of the 
stomach into the esophagus during straining. This is commonly seen with 
GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease). Management will include antacids, 
lifestyle modifications like health diet and exercise and avoiding alcohol, 
smoking and caffeine. Also you have mentioned that you have diabetes make 
you more prone to GERD. If the symptoms are not relieved by these measures, 
I would suggest that you consult your gastroenterologist who may require an 
endoscopy.
