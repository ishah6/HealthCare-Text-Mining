Any change in your diet will have an effect, and most will tell you not to diet, but change the way you eat permanently to have long lasting results. Say you:
-eat what you usually eat, but less of it
-start incorporating exercise, even just 5 minutes to start if you want, just start doing more than you were
-find alternatives to what you do eat, instead of pork bacon, opt for turkey bacon(I actually liked it a LOT better!!!), instead of margarine or butter, buy the light kind, small changes...(big ones if you want, but you are more likely to keep up with it if you arent altering and cutting out EVERYTHING you usually have)
-try to eat in more instead of dining out as often as you do, or if you do eat out, try the smaller portions
-Lessen the intake of red meat and opt for more chicken,fish,tuna etc. 

I noticed small changes made a great impact, and it was something I could do. I lost ten pounds the first month by just trying to incorporate more activity and consciously making an effort- and it worked. No diets, drugs, etc...
I hope this helps!
