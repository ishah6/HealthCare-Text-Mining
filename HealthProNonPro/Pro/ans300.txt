Fibroid tumors are non-cancerous (benign) growths in the uterus. Though 
they arise most often in the body of the uterus, in rare cases fibroids may 
also present in the cervix (2% of cases). The fibroids of the cervix are 
usually single and cause distortion and elongation of the cervical canal. A 
large cervical fibroid may cause complete obstruction and blockage of the 
cervix. Though sub-total hysterectomy is frequently performed, surgical 
removal of the cervix may be needed in your case to remove the cervical 
fibroid and also prevent chances of cervical cancer.
