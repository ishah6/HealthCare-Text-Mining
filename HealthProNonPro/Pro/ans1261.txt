Thank you for your question. This is referred to as female epispadias. This 
is a rare congenital malformation of the external female genitalia. It is 
often associated with a malformation of the bladder, known as bladder 
extrophy. This would have been evident at birth and would have required 
immediate surgical correction. Assuming your daughter did not have bladder 
extrophy, female epispadias can result in anatomically abnormal appearance 
of the vagina as well as urinary incontinence.This condition is not fatal, but she may develop trouble with urination in 
the future. It is important to monitor this and if she develops problems 
with urinary incontinence, it would be time to consult a specialist to 
determine if this can be corrected surgicallyThank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com with your medical question.
