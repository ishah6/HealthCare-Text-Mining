The symptoms of feeling drunk that your daughter is experiencing after 
delivery could be due to anemia, a result of excessive blood loss during 
pregnancy or hypoglycemia. I would suggest that your daughter consult her 
doctor for a physical examination, blood pressure and a complete blood 
count to make a diagnosis. I would suggest that your daughter increase her 
fluid intake and avoid standing up suddenly. I wish her a quick recovery, 
take care.
