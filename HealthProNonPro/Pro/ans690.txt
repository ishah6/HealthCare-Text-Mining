It is difficult for me to point out a cause for your pain abdomen. 
Examination, blood work and imaging studies (ultrasound) may be required to 
detect the underlying pathology. The common causes of pain are ovarian 
cysts, mittelschmerz, PID, fibroids and endometriosis. An ovarian cyst may 
be diagnosed by an ultrasound or a CT.
