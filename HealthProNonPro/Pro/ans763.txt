It is possible that your itchy scalp could be due to a persistent fungal 
infection which requires a stronger prescription anti-fungal treatment than 
which you have been using. Usually these medications will also a contain a 
topical coriticosteroid to reduce the inflammation and itching, along with 
a stronger dosage of antifungal medication to clear this persistent scalp 
infection. Please consult your doctor to be examined and start treatment as 
soon as you can.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
