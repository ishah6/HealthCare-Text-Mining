check out www.webmd.com and look up prostate biopsy
this is a good website for medical info.... although you should also ask the person during the procedure to explain what exactly they are going to do...they should also give u some literature
But i recommend the procedure because so many men have prostate cancer that is so advanced because they waited to long to get their prostate checked
