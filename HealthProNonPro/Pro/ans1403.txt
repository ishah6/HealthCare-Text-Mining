The most probable cause could be due to achilles tendinitis or a calcaneal 
bony spur. The tendinitis may be caused due to stress on the achilles 
tendon caused by excessive running, improper footwear and weight bearing 
for prolonged periods of time. Medication like steroids may also weaken the 
tendon. You will have to visit a orthopaedic surgeon for a complete 
physical examination and investigatory tests. Although X-rays may not 
reveal the tendonitis, it may be able to determine the presence of a bone 
spur. Treatment will depend on the symptoms, with rest, ice, compression 
and elevation of the joint providing initial relief. Anti-inflammatory 
medications, casts and injections may be required in some cases with 
surgery reserved for the most severe.
