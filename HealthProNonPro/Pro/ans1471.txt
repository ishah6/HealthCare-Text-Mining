The shin numbness might be due to diverse causes: peripheral neuropathy, 
diabetes or lumbar spine nerve compression. You have a previous history of 
spine surgery with rods may be or not related with the current complain. In 
the younger patients, lumbar radiculopathy may be a result of a disc 
herniation or an acute injury causing impingement of an exiting nerve. In 
the older patient, cervical radiculopathy is often a result of spinal canal 
narrowing from bone (osteophyte) formation, decreased disc height and 
degenerative changes due to aging process. The treatment strategy usually 
includes: a physical therapy program aimed to reduce pain and inflammation, 
and the use of anti-inflammatory medication (Aleve, Motrin), also a 
re-education of your habits and posture to improve quality of life. You 
should be independent in a stretching and strengthening program and 
continue with these exercises under the periodic supervision of a physical 
therapist initially and then completely on your own. I strongly recommend 
you to have a comprehensive evaluation by a spine surgeon to assess the 
current status of the synthesis material (rods) and determine if you are 
having a radicualr compression.
