Cephalexin belongs to a class of antibiotics called cephalosporins and is 
used to treat infections like infections of the ear, tonsils, throat and 
pneumonia. Though the drug has not been studies in pregnant women, animal 
studies have shown that it causes negative effects on the fetus. I would 
suggest that you let your health care provider know that you were on the 
drug. He or she will consider the benefits and risks of cephalexin during 
pregnancy before making a recommendation for your particular situation.
