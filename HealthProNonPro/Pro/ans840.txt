Many of the antibiotics and treatment for acne are not safe during 
pregnancy. The use of accutane during pregnancy may lead to congenital 
defects in the baby. Long term usage of antibiotics prior to pregnancy will 
not harm your pregnancy in the future. You must be off Accutane for at 
least a month before planning for conception. It usually takes 10-14 days 
for the drug to be cleared from the system but for precautionary measures 1 
month is required. You should only use azifast (azithromycin) in pregnancy 
if it is deemed necessary by your doctor.
