A urine pregnancy test is best done after 2 weeks of the sexual act. It is 
also advisable to test it on the morning urine sample. You may need to 
re-test it after another 4 days to confirm whether you are pregnant or not. 
A delayed period may due to a lot of factors with stress being a common 
one. If your periods are not regular in the next 2-3 month, I would suggest 
that you see your doctor.
