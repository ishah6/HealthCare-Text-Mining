Thank you for your question. There are a number of causes of testicular 
atrophy (shrinkage). This can range from poor circulation, the use of 
steroids, genetic mutations or even cancer. We are not certain what could 
have caused your testicle to shrink, but the pain you are experiencing 
concerns us. We recommend that you promptly consult a urologist to 
determine what actually caused your testicle to shrink and to determine if 
you are fertile by conducting a sperm analysis. Theoretically speaking, if 
you have a single healthy functioning testicle, it is possible to produce 
viable sperm cable of impregnation. Please see a urologist immediately for 
further examination and investigations.AskTheDoctor.com wishes you a rapid recovery.
