Methadone is an opioid (a synthetic opiate) that was originally 
synthesized by German pharmaceutical companies during the second world war. 
It was first marketed as ‘Dolophine’ and was used as an analgesic (a 
painkiller) for the treatment of severe pain. It is still occasionally used 
for pain relief. Methadone is now primarily used today for the treatment of 
narcotic addiction. The effects of methadone last longer than those of 
morphine-based drugs. Methadone’s effects can last up to 36 hours, 
permitting administration only once a day in heroin detoxification and 
maintenance programs. Methadone generally entails the entire spectrum of 
opioid side effects, including the development of tolerance and physical 
and psychological dependence. Other symptoms are: constipation, nausea or 
vomiting, sedation, vertigo, edema. As an opiate, regular use of methadone 
causes physical dependency, and once you stop , you will experience a 
withdrawal. The physical changes due to the drug are similar to other 
opiates (like heroin); suppressed cough reflex, contracted pupils, 
drowsiness and constipation. Some methadone users feel sick when they first 
use the drug. In women using methadone may not have regular periods , but 
they are still able to conceive.
