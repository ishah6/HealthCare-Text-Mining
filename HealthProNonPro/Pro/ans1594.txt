These growth could be genital warts caused by Human Papillomavirus (HPV). 
HPV infection around the genitals is common, although most people have no 
symptoms. HPV infection is passed from one person to another through sexual 
contact. You may need to get the lesion examined by your doctor to determine the 
presence of warts. Treatment options include podophyllin cream, freezing by 
cryotherapy, elecrocautery and surgical excision.
