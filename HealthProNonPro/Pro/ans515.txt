I do understand your concern. Postcoital bleeding can be a sign of an 
underlying pathology and is usually alarming to the patient. Common causes 
of bleeding could be due to cervicitis, cervical polyps, cervical ectropion 
and cervical cancer. This is further complicated because of your history of 
Von Willebrand disease. There is no specific diagnostic workup for post 
coital bleed. Your doctor may need to examine you and look for possible 
sources of bleeding. Other investigation that may be required are 
colposcopy and biopsy as well as evaluation of vaginal fluid for 
trichomoniasis and bacterial vaginosis.
