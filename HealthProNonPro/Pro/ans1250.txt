Thank you for your question. There is no medical condition associated with 
this odour being present in the urine. Strong odour to the urine in 
toddlers such as your daughter may be indicative of a developing urinary 
tract infection. What we suggest is that you promptly take her to her 
pediatrician to have her urine tested to for any bacterial infections. If 
this is not the case, then it is possible that there could be something 
that she is eating that is causing her urine to smell this way. Please be 
guided accordingly.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
