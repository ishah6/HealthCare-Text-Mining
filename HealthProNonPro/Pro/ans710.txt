It is difficult for someone to go through what you are experiencing and I 
do understand your concern. It is likely that you have 
Mayer-Rokitansky-Küster-Hauser (MRKH) syndrome. This is is a disorder that 
occurs in females and mainly affects the reproductive system. This 
condition causes the vagina and uterus to be underdeveloped or absent. 
Affected women usually do not have menstrual periods due to the absent 
uterus. Often, the first noticeable sign of MRKH syndrome is that 
menstruation does not begin by age 16 (primary amenorrhea). Women with MRKH 
syndrome have a female chromosome pattern (46,XX) and normally functioning 
ovaries. They also have normal female external genitalia and normal breast 
and pubic hair development. MRKH syndrome affects approximately 1 in 4,500 
newborn girls. The cause of MRKH syndrome is unknown, although it probably 
results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors.It is unlikely that your uterus will get bigger. Although women with this 
condition are usually unable to carry a pregnancy, they may be able to have 
children through assisted reproduction. Women with 
Mayer-Rokitansky-Kuster-Hauser syndrome can become pregnant by having 
oocytes harvested, fertilized, and implanted in a surrogate. I hope I could 
be of some help, take care.
