Loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP) is a procedure in which a 
low voltage current is used to remove the abnormal tissue of the cervix. 
Though LEEP has fewer side-effects as compared to CO2 laser and 
cryocautery, it can cause stenosis (narrowing) of the cervix, infection and 
increased bleeding.It is difficult to say whether the irregular menses is caused by LEEP or 
due to an underlying disorder. I would suggest that you see your doctor for 
further evaluation. I wish you well, take care.
