I agree with your doctor possibly the cholesterol medication (statins) is 
the culprit of your symptoms. Sometimes this type of medications may cause 
a condition that result in the breakdown of skeletal muscle tissue, leading 
to kidney failure. Then, if you have unexplained muscle pain, tenderness, 
or weakness especially if you also have fever, unusual tiredness, and dark 
colored urine, call your doctor because taking too much or too long of this 
medication may cause serious or life-threatening side effects.
