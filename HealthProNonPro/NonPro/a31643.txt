I believe that parents get wrapped up in their jobs and trying to provide for their family.  They also, sometimes, get wrapped up in their own lives.  Im afraid that I know of too many families that parents are too wrapped up in their selves to even pay attention to their children.  I dont think its right.  Parents should spend quality time getting to know their children.
