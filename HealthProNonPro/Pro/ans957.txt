Pain around the belly button and history of vomiting could be due to 
gastroenteritis, appendicitis or renal stones. I would suggest that you 
consult your doctor for an examination and necessary tests. Your doctor may 
order blood-work, an ultrasound and an abdominal x-ray to make a diagnosis. 
Treatment ill depend on the cause. In the meantime it is important that you 
keep yourself well hydrated. I wish you well, take care.
