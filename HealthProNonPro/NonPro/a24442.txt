Hmm impressive, you have got a large audience!

Um haha...
First things first!
Watch at least 2 episodes of FRIENDS(it is great for releasing any tension, especailly if you are laughing)

Take a long bath and read your fave book...and dont put candles around they are going to make you nervous (oh I dont know maybe it will fall...)

Clean up your own room, it will help but only if you are in the mood otherwise just put on your fave tunes and take a stroll!

Have fun!
