Thank you for your question. Prescription medications such as Zoloft can be 
affected by the use of any herbal supplements. The ingredients that you 
have listed in your herbal tea may or may not be associated with adverse 
interactions with your medication. Since there is very little information 
existing on the interaction with herbal supplements and your medication, we 
cannot advise you that it would be safe to use this herbal tea along with 
your medication. Once you are off your Zoloft you may proceed with any 
herbal treatment at your own risk provided that you are not on any other 
medications.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
