It sounds like he has a drinking problem.  Youre doing nothing wrong, except being dragged into his trauma.  If hes consistently drinking so much that he passes out, then thats his problem, and its a classic sign of alcohol dependency.

Im also concerned that hes having problems reaching orgasm except when hes so rough that hes hurting you.  He should be respectful of your needs.

It sounds like hes got some dependency/addiction issues starting, and he needs help.  Tell him, when hes sober, what youre concerned about.
