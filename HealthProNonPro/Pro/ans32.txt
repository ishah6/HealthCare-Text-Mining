A sweet smelling urine may indicate the presence of sugars in the urine. 
This may occur in uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, diabetic ketoacidosis and 
in rare cases mapel syrup urine disease. I would suggest that you consult 
your doctor for a urinalysis, kidney function tests and blood glucose 
levels to rule out diabetes and underlying urinary infection.
