If you keep a balanced and healthy diet you should have trouble gaining 
body mass. Protein sources from Egg, Casein, and Whey will help in building 
body mass. Casein has a high glutamine content which helps preserve muscle 
mass. Egg protein is low in calories and has a great amino acid profile. 
Egg protein can be consumed at most meals throughout the day. Whey protein 
may help stimulate muscle growth by increasing insulin-like growth 
factor-1. I would also advise some form of weight-lifting exercise to 
promote faster muscle growth along with the recommended protein diet.
