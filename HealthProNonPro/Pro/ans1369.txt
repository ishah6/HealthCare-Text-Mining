The knee pain that shows up when sitting for a long time, 
ascending/descending stairs or do activities that requiere frequent 
kneeling, is the most common presentation of the Patello Femoral Syndrome 
or Chondromalacia Patella. ." The causes are diverse: Overuse (repetitive 
use or activity), overloading, and misuse of the patellofemoral joint. The 
suggested strategy for conservative treatment should be as follows: 
Physical therapy program (exercises and pain control with TENS, ultrasound, 
ice packs after exercises), anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e.: “Aleve”, 
“Advil”), education about which activities avoid because those can 
aggravate patellofemoral syndrome. Also, and very important, is to remark 
the need for extended adherence to the exercise regimen even at home. Allow 
time for these conservative measures (ei: exercise program) to have an 
effect, usually 4-6 weeks is adequate for some resolution of symptoms.
