The itching may be caused due to an allergic reaction or due to pathogens 
such as dust mites and scabies infection. Your friend may need to see if he 
has been in contact with a new object in the house such as clothes, bed 
sheets, soap or creams. If the itching continues your friend may need to 
see an allergist/dermatologist to identify the cause. Treatment with 
antihistamines like cetirizine and topical anesthetic creams will help 
relieve the symptoms.
