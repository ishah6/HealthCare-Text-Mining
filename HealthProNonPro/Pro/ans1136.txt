Thank you for your question. Constipation after abdominal surgery is very 
common. It can be caused by the surgery itself, general anesthesia, and 
certain pain medications such as opiate analgesics. We first recommend that 
your father increase his water intake to assist in softening the stool in 
order to have a bowel movement. He can also be prescribed a mild stool 
softener by his surgeon to assist in his bowel movements. If he does not 
have a bowel movement from these please take him back to the surgeon for 
further evaluation.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
