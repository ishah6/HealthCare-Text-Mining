Sinusitis is the inflammation of the nasal sinuses by viral, bacterial or 
fungal infection. There is collection of mucus and plugging of the sinus 
cavities. Though your symptoms may be due to sinusitis, you may also need 
to consider an allergic pathology. If regular over the counter 
antihistamines, saline nasal rinses and regular steam inhalation are 
ineffective, I would suggest you to consult your doctor for a sinus x-ray 
or CT.
