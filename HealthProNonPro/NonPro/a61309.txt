Muscle and tissue bruise, bones break - depending on the position of the arm or leg it is absolutely possible to break it. If it is in a position that is not propped up like a board enough force can cause a hair line fracture at the point of impact and surrounding area. Greater force can cause it to snap completely or partially. If it is placed in a position i.e. leaning against something and you hit the elbow like a board, you are very likely to break the arm, and with enough force and technique, certain to break the arm.

 Plus my friend punched a wooden display board at school for fun, his fingers snapped, he should us the x-ray the next day and his finger was hanging on by a thread. The surrounding tissue turned all black and bruised as well.
