A number of medications including certain antibiotics decrease the levels 
of oral contraceptives in the blood. The actual decrease in the 
effectiveness of the oral contraceptive pill due to antibiotics has not 
been studied.Because of a theoretical increased chances of pregnancy when using 
antibiotics with birth control pills, I would advise additional methods of 
protection like condoms.
