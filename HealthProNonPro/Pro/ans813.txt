Itching and rashes, though rare, is a side effect of HCG diet. During and 
HCG diet, the body breaks down fat at a faster rate than normal. As the fat 
breaks down, there is accumulation of certain toxins that may cause stress 
on the liver and rash. I would definitely advise you to review your diet 
with your doctor and get a liver function test done. Elevation liver 
enzymes (bilirubin) could be causing your skin rash. Other causes could be 
contact dermatitis. Try to identify any new product that you may have come 
into contact which would have caused the rash. Specific treatment will 
depend on the cause. I hope this helps, take care.
