Most patients spend the first night in ICU and then transfer out to the cardiac stepdown unit the next day.  Usually you will spend another 4-5 days in the cardiac unit before going home.  While in the hospital, the nurse or cardiac rehab person will make you walk at least 3 times per day in order to help you get your strength back.  Uusaly no lifting or return to work or anything strenuous for at least 2 months if not longer.  You should be enrolled in outpatient cardiac rehab where they will monitor you on a weely or semi weekly basis.  You should be walking at home... better yet at the Y or something so someone can watch you... initially you will be walking at the rehab center.  

Good luck with the surgery, I have worked with open heart patients for the last 5 years so I would be happy to answer any more questions you have!
