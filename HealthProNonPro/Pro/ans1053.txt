Since you have been off depo there is a probability that you may be 
pregnant. Home pregnancy tests are best done on the day of the missed 
period or around two weeks after unprotected sex. You can also do a serum 
pregnancy test that is more sensitive and be able to detect pregnancy 
earlier. I wish you the best.
