"Trans" and "cis" configurations of the same molecule are called "stereoisomers".These fats are not good for heart and can cause heart diseases.Ayurveda treatment is effective and natural way to remove fat.It does not have any side.effect.The first ayurvedic secret is the Detox Tea. This tea is one of my favorite tools for fighting fat. The combination of ingredients helps to improve digestion, break down fat, and â€œunclogâ€ the channels in our body by removing ama. The key is to make the tea fresh every morning, place it in a thermos, and take small sips of it throughout the day. It is best to drink it warm or hot.
