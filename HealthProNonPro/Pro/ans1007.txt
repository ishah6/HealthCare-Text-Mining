Pregnant women are not advised to use the Medifast diet plan. During the 
diet process the body’s food take is controlled and manipulated to achieve 
the required weight loss process thus resulting in malnutrition. 
Malnutrition can disrupt the development of the baby inside the womb and 
may even lead to fatal complications. I would advise you not to undergo any 
diet program during pregnancy. You may try consuming more fibres and green 
vegetables and also try mild exercises as an alternative to the diet 
programs.
