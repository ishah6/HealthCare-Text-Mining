My dear,if you can go as long as you want but dont stop drinking liquids,you can drink soups,the juice of the veggies,broth chicken or beef,drink more nectar then juices,dont forget gatoradeand it would be good if you do it for fasting youll see the temptations coming like you have no idea,pray a lot that God help you,but if you dont do it for that,just dont do it
