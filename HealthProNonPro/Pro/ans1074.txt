Sometimes cervical spine problems may coexist with shoulder problems 
derived from previous injuries. In your daughter’s particular case these 
two entities must be ruled out and treated. Also, it would be important to 
rule out inflammation of the peripheral nerves at the level of the arm and 
hand. In the younger patients, as your daughter, cervical radiculopathy may 
be a result of a disc herniation or an acute injury causing impingement of 
an exiting nerve. I recommend a comprehensive evaluation, including imaging 
studies (MRI) and electrophysiology studies (EMG) to determine the cause of 
the symptoms and proceed with the right treatment option accordingly.
