It is unlikely that your bleeding is due to implantation. Implantation 
bleed, also called implantation spotting is not like a regular menstrual 
period but presents with scanty pinkish or brownish discharge and usually 
occurs 6 to 12 days after ovulation and fertilization. However, you may do 
a home pregnancy test to confirm pregnancy.
