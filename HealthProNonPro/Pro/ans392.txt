I am sorry to hear what you have been experiencing. It is difficult at this 
moment to say what chances are there for a viable pregnancy. Sometimes it 
may take serial ultrasounds to confirm a diagnosis. Sometimes an ultrasound 
will give uncertain results and repeat ultrasound is ordered. The wait for 
the repeated ultrasound can be emotionally very difficult, but it may be 
necessary in order to avoid a misdiagnosis. You may even consult your 
doctor for quantitative HCG analysis. A rising level of HCG will indicate a 
viable pregnancy. If the next ultrasound shows nothing in the sac, it is 
either a blighted ovum (which means a baby did not form, only the sac) or 
it is a pseudo sac (fake sac). I wish you well and do hope for a positive 
outcome.
