The most probable cause of the swelling in your vagina could be due to a 
bartholin's cyst. This is caused by obstruction of the opening of the 
Bartholin gland that is present on each side of the vagina. If the fluid in 
the cyst gets infected, an abscess is formed.Treatment depends on the size of the cyst and whether an abscess is 
present. Small cysts will require sitz bath. Larger cysts and abscess will 
require surgical drainage and antibiotics.
