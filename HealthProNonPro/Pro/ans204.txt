Constipation certainly is a common condition in children and is considered 
one of the most common causes for a visit to the Pediatrician. The most 
common cause of it is dietary, decreasing foods that are constipating, 
including cow's milk, bananas, yogurt, cheese, cooked carrots and other 
foods that are low in fiber. For children that drink a lot of milk, soy 
milk is a good alternative, as it is usually much less constipating than 
cow's milk and surely increasing the fiber and clear fluids in his diet. 
Sometimes constipation in a child could be due to anxiety or anal fissures. 
If increasing his fluid intake and Glycerin suppositories do not help, 
consult your child`s doctor for a history and physical examination. I wish 
your son a prompt recovery.
