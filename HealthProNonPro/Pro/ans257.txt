Eating disorder may affect people leading to symptoms like anxiety, 
depression, hopelessness and low self esteem. There may be psychological 
symptoms such as constant thoughts about food, weight, shape and exercise.Restricting your food intake and use of laxatives will cause physical 
problems which can lead to serious illness. Low body weight may lead to 
slowing of the heart rate and low blood pressure. You may feel tired, 
faint, dizzy, have palpitations.There are many health problems caused by excessive laxative use. Laxatives 
misuse causes dehydration, bringing faintness, tiredness and headache. It 
can also cause severe depletion of essential minerals, which are present in 
the fluid within the bowel.Even the blood test may not detect the laxative levels, the depleted levels 
of potassium, phosphate, calcium, zinc and magnesium may indicate laxative 
abuse. When potassium levels in the body fall, the heart may lose its 
regular beating rhythm. This may cause faintness or even loss of 
consciousness.I would suggest that you discuss your eating problems with your doctor. 
Together with the help of your doctor and family you can work on a 
long-term recovery plan.
