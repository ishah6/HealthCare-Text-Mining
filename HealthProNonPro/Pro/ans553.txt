I suggest that you have a comprehensive evaluation by your PCP to rule out 
a vitamin deficiency, specifically Vitamin B.The B-complex vitamins are 
absolutely essential for a number of necessary metabolic processes such as 
red blood cell synthesis, maintenance of a healthy nervous system and the 
production of energy. All B complex vitamins are water soluble. They 
provide energy from using carbs and converting them to glucose. B-complex 
vitamins are also essential for the metabolism of proteins and fat. 
B-complex vitamins work together, so it is important to take them all at 
the same time. Vitamin B and weight loss go hand in hand, but only when all 
forms of vitamin B are taken together: Riboflavin(B2), Niacin(B3), 
Panthotenic Acid(B5),Pyridoxine (B6), Cyanocobalamin (B12). Vitamin B12 
causes the metabolism to speed up, which in turn increases weight loss. 
Shots give a tremendous boost of energy. This generally helps people to 
maintain their diets, and motivates them to exercise and increase physical 
activity. Vitamin B12 also helps to fight stress, anxiety and depression. 
Vitamin B12 deficiency may result in anemia, problems with the peripheral 
nerves, memory loss and cognitive decline. It is very rare that a person 
get overdosed of Vitamin B complex because they are water soluble, which 
means that the excess you may take is eliminated by urine. Sometimes you 
may see negative effects as rash or allergy, but not dents in the nails.
