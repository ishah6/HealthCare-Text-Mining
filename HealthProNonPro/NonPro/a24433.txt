The first thing to do is change the way you view it. Stress is relative to your beliefs about stress. Maybe youre really busy, maybe youre tired. Then think "Im tired and busy" instead of "Im stressed". Stress is a label that makes you think youre sick.

Now that youre thinking "Im too busy and Im tired" you can look at your situation in manageble bits. 

Hmmmmmm, what can I do about being too busy? Do I expect too much from myself? Is there something I can let go of? Honestly, sometimes when I feel too busy, I let my housework go a little. Dropping one of those toilet cleaner things in the tank is a "stress" reducer for me :-) 

Next, the tiredness, well, do you get enough sleep? Can you manage to get your body laying in bed by 9:00? Or at least 10:00?? Can you eat your dinner a little earlier (you should not lay down for three hours after your meal).

I agree that meditating and breathing are helpful (well, breathing is critical!) but first I really believe that much of the problem with stress is letting it have a life of its own. Kill the stree beast!! Look it in the eye and say you dont believe in the boogy-man!
