Symptoms of headache, neck stiffness and lethargy are certainly features of 
meningitis, keeping in mind that your daughter was suffering from sore 
throat the past 4 days, I would definitely advice you to go to the ER 
immediately. Meningitis is a medical emergency and needs immediate 
management. I wish your daughter a speedy recovery, take care.
