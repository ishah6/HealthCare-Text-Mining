I do understand your concern for your fiance's nose bleed. It is true that 
nose bleeds are associated with hepatitis C. In my opinion, your fiance's 
nose bleed could be due to either a lack of clotting factors because of the 
liver damage or due to an autoimmune (idiopathic) thrombocytopenic purpura 
due to hepatitis C infection. I would suggest that your fiance consult a 
gastroenterologist and a hematologist for further evaluation of his 
condition. The investigation that he may be required to do are a complete 
blood count, peripheral blood smear, liver function tests, clotting 
factors, platelet levels and viral levels of hepatitis C to determine the 
cause of his bleeding. Treatment will depend on the cause and correction of 
the clotting parameters. I hope the answer helps you, I wish your fiance a 
prompt recovery, take carer.
