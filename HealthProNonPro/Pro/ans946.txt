Osteoarthritis is a degenerative disease that involves the whole joints, 
affecting not only the bones but ligaments, joint lining and joint cover 
(capsule) and also involves a progressive loss of cartilage. Osteoarthritis 
(OA) is the most common articular disease worldwide, affecting over 20 
million individuals in the United States alone. The main symptoms are the 
aching pain, stiffness or difficulty moving the affected joints, for 
example: fingers, hips, knees and spine. Besides the drug treatment as 
Tylenol, which is the first drug recommended for osteoarthritis, there are 
several ways to help to improve the quality of life as follows: keep the 
weight under control, regular exercise may help to strengthen muscles and 
stimulate the cartilage growth, avoid high impact sports, taking 
antioxidant vitamins as C and E may provide some protection, also vitamin 
D(400 UI per day) and Calcium (1000-1200 mgs per day), hot soaks and warm 
paraffin application may relieve the pain, there are also assistive devices 
that can be used to improve function, alignment, provide support or correct 
deformities such as splints, braces, walkers, canes and orthopedic 
footwear. The arthritis foundation offers programs aimed to educate you
