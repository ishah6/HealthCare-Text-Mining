Cervical cancer and pneumonia are two separate entities and are not 
related. A person with cervical cancer is prone to getting pneumonia due to 
a weakened immune system. Residents of nursing homes and other long-term 
health care facilities and anyone who has been hospitalized is at a risk of 
acquiring pneumonia.
