That I will know that I lived life to the fullest, that I never committed a crime that victimized others, that I made it my way and on my own (which I have).  

That those who did hurt and commit crimes against me (including the robberies, property damage, and violence that my ex committed) that he WILL Be in Leg Irons and Handcuffs being escorted into the Jail for a LONG LONG Time behind bars -- and I wont be victimized by this Abuser ever again -- in life or in death.
