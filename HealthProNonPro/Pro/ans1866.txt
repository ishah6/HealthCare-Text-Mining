Your symptoms would have most probably been caused by pharyngitis which is 
aggravated by your smoking. However you will required an examination by an 
otolaryngologist (ENT doctor) for a complete examination to rule out 
anything serious. You may try warm saline gargles and stop smoking to see 
if your symptoms relieve. I wish you well, take care.
