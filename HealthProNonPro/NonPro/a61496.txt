Honestly hon, this isnt your fault. Why should you have to try to keep him hard? If he cant, hes got issues. Tell him to lay off the booze if he wants to get off because you shouldnt have to work so hard. If he is getting violent with you, you should probably reconsider your situation. This may only be the tip of the iceburg. You are not a servant, you are a woman who should be treated with respect. If wants to get off so bad, and he cant manage to stay awake long enough for it, tell him to beat off.
