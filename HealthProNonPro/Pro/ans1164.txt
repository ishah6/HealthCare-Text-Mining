Thank you for your question. It is possible that the dilation of the 
urethral meatus could be due to tightening of the skin surrounding the 
glans penis. This can be due to a condition known as phimosis. This 
condition occurs due to tightening of the foreskin. This is if you 
uncircumcised. If however you have been circumcised, the dilation of the 
penile urethra could be due inflammation, or a more serious condition 
relating to the penis or surrounding structures. We recommend that you have 
your doctor perform a complete genital exam. We cannot determine what the 
exact cause of this is without a physical exam. Please see your doctor as 
soon as you can.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
