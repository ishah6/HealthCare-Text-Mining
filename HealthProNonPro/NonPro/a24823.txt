This may sound trite, but look at the Food Guide Pyramid.  Eat from all of the food groups listed, including the recommended daily allowance of each.  I think serving sizes is the key!  How many slices of  pizza constitutes a serving size?  Do we really only eat one cup of cereal in the morning?  How often do we really eat 5 or more servings of veggies every day?

Calcium plays a big part in metabolism and weight loss, so drink your milk!  Also, be sure to drink the appropriate amount of water each day.  It flushes out body wastes and toxins, and helps to control "water weight."
