I think the circular skin you are referring may be caused due to common 
warts. These warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and is 
extremely common in young adults. They are usually seen the in the hands 
and feet. Treatment options are i) salicylic acid preparation in the form 
of gels, plasters and corn caps ii) freezing of the wart by liquid nitrogen 
and iii) surgical removal in extreme cases. These warts usually go off on 
its own even without treatment, but since you've mentioned that it's been 
three years since its been there, I would advise you to visit a 
dermatologist for an opinion.
