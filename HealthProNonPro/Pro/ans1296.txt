Thank you for your question.Any permanent filler used in the face is very difficult to remove. Most 
permanent fillers have non-soluble, inorganic particles that are not broken 
down by the body. My personal suggestion would be to avoid any type of 
permanent filler for any area of the face. If you have had a permanent 
filler injected into your lips and are looking to have it removed, a 
plastic surgeon may be able to make a small incision at the border of your 
lip to attempt removing the injected material. It is however very difficult 
to adequately localize and remove all the particles and residual filler may 
remain following the procedure.
