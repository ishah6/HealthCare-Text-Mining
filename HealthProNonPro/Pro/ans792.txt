It is very important that you get yourself examined to rule out breast 
cancer. Though most breast cancers are not painful, a painful breast lump 
does not rule out the possibility of breast cancer. Other causes of painful 
breast lumps are inflammatory conditions, breast infections or abscesses, 
breast cysts and fibroadenomas. I would advise that you schedule an 
appointment with your doctor for a breast examination. Your doctor may also 
require an ultrasound, fine needle aspiration or a biopsy to confirm a 
diagnosis.
