Possibly you are experiencing a Hip tendinitis or bursitis, which is an 
inflammation of the hip bursa or hip tendons caused by repetitive use, 
trauma, infection, or systemic inflammatory disease, in your case may be 
caused by repetitive daily living activities. Bursae are flattened sacs 
that serve as a protective buffer between bones and overlapping muscles 
(deep bursae) or between bones and tendons/skin (superficial bursae). These 
synovial-lined sacs are filled with minimal amounts of fluid to facilitate 
movement during muscle contraction. Deep bursae, such as the subacromial 
(shoulder) and iliopsoas (hip) bursae, are located in the fascia. Symptoms 
of bursitis may or not include localized tenderness, swelling, redness, 
and/or reduced /limited movement. Most likely the treatment for bursitis 
or tendinitis is conservative and aimed to reduce inflammation and of 
course the pain. Conservative treatment includes rest, local cold and heat 
treatments, elevation, no steroidal anti-inflammatory medication (“Motrin”, 
“Aleve”), if needed :bursal aspiration, and intrabursal steroid injections 
(with or without local anesthetic agents. It would be important, in a 
person of your young age, to rule out other bone problems mostly in the 
femur head, which might be causing the pain that you described.
