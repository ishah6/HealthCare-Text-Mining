You may grow some more but I cant say you will. Youre only a couple of inches shorter than what is considered average for a women your age. Are you troubled by your height? You shouldnt be. Celebrate the fact you are who you are. 

As a man, I tend to be on the short side of average but I dont obsess over my stature. I recognize that whatever my height versus other men or women, there are things that I can do better than they can. 

I imagine you have talents and skills that set you apart from your peers, whether its an ability to run fast, solve equations quickly or some other attribute you possess. Refine whatever abilities you have through practice. If someone is giving you a hard time about your height, thats his problem not yours and it says more about him than it does you. 

Keep your chin up. The worst thing you can do is dwell on your limitations or aspects of your person that you cant change (without radical surgery).
