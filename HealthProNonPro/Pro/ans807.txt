It seems you are suffering from a chronic laryngitis. There are several 
causes for this including chronic smoking, acid reflux disease, infections, 
excessive alcohol use and exposure to dust, chemicals and fumes. Since 
you've already taken antibiotics, I do no think infection is the cause of 
your laryngitis. Acid reflux is a common cause which is overlooked. you 
should have yourself assessed for this condition and treatment started if 
necessary. Note, that in long-standing pharyngitis it may take some time 
for the voice to return to its original quality even after treatment.
