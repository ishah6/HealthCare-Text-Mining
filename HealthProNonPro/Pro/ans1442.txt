The painful red lump inside your nose is a result of nasal folliculitis. 
This occurs as a result of infection off hair follicle by bacteria. Most 
nose pimples or folliculitis clear without treatment, although some may 
require topical antibiotics. It is important not to poke or touch inside 
your nostrils.
