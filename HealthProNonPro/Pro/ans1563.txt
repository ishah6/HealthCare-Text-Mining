There could be many causes that would have led to decreased sensation in 
the toes. Pressure on the nerves of the spine due to a herniated disc, a 
lower back injury, diabetes, hypothyroidism, vitamin B12 deficiency, 
alcohol or peripheral vascular disease may cause similar symptoms.I would adive that you consult your doctor for a complete blood count, 
electrolyte levels, thyroid function tests, sugar levels, vascular 
ultrasound and MRI of the spine. The treatment will depend on the causative 
pathology. I hope you will find the information useful.
