The test ordered by your endocrinologist is an overnight dexamethasone 
suppression test to see the changes in the level of cortisol (a hormone) in 
the blood. This test is done to check for a condition known as cushing`s 
disease which is caused by a tumor of the pituitary gland. I hope you will 
find the information useful, I wish you well.
