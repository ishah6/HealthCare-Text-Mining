Since you were prescribed antibiotics before the test, there is a small 
chance that the negative test could be the result of the antibiotics. I 
would advise you to continue with your antibiotics and avoid unprotected 
intercourse. It is important to test your partner for the infection because 
there is a chance for re-infection if both couples are not treated.
