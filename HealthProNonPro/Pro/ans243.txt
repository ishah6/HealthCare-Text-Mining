Doxycycline may completely cure chlamydia infection in 95% of cases after 
one course of antibiotics. However since you still have signs of vaginitis, 
I would recommend that you see your doctor for microscopical examination 
and culture of the discharge.You should refrain form sexual intercourse at this time until your partner 
has been tested and treated for chlamydial infection.
