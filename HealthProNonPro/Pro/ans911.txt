Most probably these bumps are papillae of the tongue and are not evidence 
of something serious. Papillae on the tongue grown continuously through our 
lifetime and sometime may harbor bacteria that might cause some 
inflammation. This condition is not particularly common and is most likely 
to occur in people who do not practice good dental hygiene. I would suggest 
that you maintain good oral hygiene and avoid smoking. If the bumps 
disconcert you, then you may need to see your doctor.
