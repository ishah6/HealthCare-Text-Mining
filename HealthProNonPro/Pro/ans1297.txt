Thank you for your question.Double eyelid surgery in asian patients is a very common operation 
performed by plastic surgeons. As you mentioned, the creation of a double 
lid (supratarsal crease) is the goal of surgery. It is difficult to answer 
your question without examination; however, I would agree with your mother 
that most surgeons would prefer to operate on both eyelids to ensure 
symmetry post-operatively. When you meet with your surgeon, you should 
emphasize that you do not want a significant change on the one side and 
they will tailor the surgery towards matching the contralateral side the 
the double lid side. Even if not adjusting the one side very much, it would 
be very reasonable to operate on both sides to make matching identical lids.
