I do understand your concern. It is difficult for me to say whether you are 
pregnant or not based on the home pregnancy tests. I would advise you to 
see your doctor for further evaluation and order pregnancy blood tests 
which are more sensitive and accurate in determining pregnancy. I wish you 
well, take care.
