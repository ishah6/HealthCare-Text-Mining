Usually, strenuous exercise and activities must be restricted for 4 to 6 
weeks after surgery, then the exercise routine may be resumed but with 
progressive demands in order to avoid complications. It is recommended 
avoid lifting heavy weights for 3 to 4 months, you may practice aerobic 
exercises, always remember: progressively. Although the skin wound heals 
within a week or two the inside tissues take longer to heal and this 
process can go on for 6 months or more.
