Mesenteric lymphadenitis refers to the inflammation of the mesenteric lymph 
nodes in the stomach due to bacterial infection from the intestines. Often 
it is difficult to differentiate mesenteric lymphadenitis from acute 
appendicitis due to the similar presentation of symptoms. Acute 
appendicitis on the other hand is the inflammation of the vermiform 
appendix due to either infection or obstruction.
