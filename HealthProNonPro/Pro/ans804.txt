It seems unlikely that an acid reflux would wake you up from sleep and 
cause vomiting. I strongly recommend you to have an evaluation by a 
Cardiologist, it is very important to rule out a possible Angina pectoris. 
Angina is a type of chest pain caused by reduced blood flow to the heart 
muscle. Angina is a symptom of coronary artery disease. Your doctor may 
require an electrocardiogram, chest x-ray, cardiac enzymes and a stress 
test to make a diagnosis of angina. Drugs like Ranexa (Ranolazene) and 
Nitroglycerin are used for the treatment of angina symptoms. Severe cases 
may even require coronary artery stenting.
