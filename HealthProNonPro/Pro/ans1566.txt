There could be several conditions that could be causing your symptoms of 
itching groin. The most common cause of a groin itch is due to tinea 
cruris, a fungal infection. The infection occurs due to the prolonged 
wetness in the groin areas due to sweating and the friction from the 
clothes. An anti-fungal cream with hydrocortisone (a steroid) will treat 
the infection and reduce the symptoms of itching.
