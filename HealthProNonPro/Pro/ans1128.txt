Thank you for your question. Based on the nature of the impact your hand 
sustained, you could have indeed fractured a number of bones in your hand. 
In order to determine where this fracture could have been sustained, it 
would be best to have your doctor examine your hand and conduct an x ray of 
your hand to determine which bones could possibly be fractured. In the 
meantime, we recommend that you refrain from physical activity that may 
apply further impact to your hand as well as take oral analgesic medication 
to reduce the pain and inflammation. This can also be augmented by applying 
ice to the hand in 15-20 minute intervals.
