The pain in your neck and the numbness feeling in your hands as you 
described may be due to a cervical nerve compression , but it would be 
also important to rule out inflammation of the peripheral nerves at the 
level of the arm and hand. In the younger patients, cervical radiculopathy 
may be a result of a disc herniation or an acute injury or as in your case 
congenital causing impingement of an exiting nerve. In the older patient, 
cervical radiculopathy is often a result of spinal canal narrowing from 
bone (osteophyte) formation, decreased disc height and degenerative changes 
due to aging process. The treatment strategy usually includes: physical 
therapy program aimed to reduce pain and inflammation, and the use of 
anti-inflammatory medication (“Motrin”, “Aleve”), also a re-education of 
your habits and posture to improve quality of life. You should be 
independent in a stretching and strengthening program and continue with 
these exercises under the periodic supervision of a physical therapist 
initially and then completely on your own. Patients whose condition fails 
to improve with a comprehensive rehabilitation program and selective 
injections should be presented with a surgical evaluation. Often, there is 
a progressive improvement over the first 6-8 weeks with conservative 
treatment. If there is no significant improvement in this time frame, 
consider a surgical evaluation.
