You may need to see a doctor to rule our a yeast infection which could be 
the cause of your symptoms. Application of antifungal ointment like 
Canestan and Lotrimin will help in clearing the infection. You can also do 
a home pregnancy test to see whether you are pregnant or not. I wish you 
well, take care.
