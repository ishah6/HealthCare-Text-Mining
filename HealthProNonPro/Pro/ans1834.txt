Your symptoms and test results are probably indicative of chronic bacterial 
prostatitis. Unfortunately, chronic prostatitis can be difficult to 
treat. The mainstay in the treatment of chronic bacterial prostatitis is 
the use of oral antimicrobial agents. Usually the best treatment options 
available are trimethoprim sulphate and sulphamethoxazole and 
fluroquinolones.Since you've tried all measures and antibiotics, you many consult with your 
doctor on the benefit of prostatectomy in your case. TURP and TUVP may help 
remove the nidus of infection causing the chronic infection.
