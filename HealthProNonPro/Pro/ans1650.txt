Topamax or topiramate is an anticonvulsant drug. Along with the many 
side-effects of the drug, loose stools is also one of them. However, the 
symptoms of loose stool could also be related to IBS that you have 
mentioned. I would suggest that you consult your doctor to see whether the 
loose stool is related to the drug or not.
