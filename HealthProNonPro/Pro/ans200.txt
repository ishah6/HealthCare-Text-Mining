Conjunctivitis is a common eye condition. It's not serious, but it can be 
uncomfortable and irritating. Bacterial conjunctivitis is an infection 
caused by bacteria, such as staphylococci, streptococci or haemophilus. 
Bacterial conjunctivitis should clear up on its own within five days. 
Antibiotics does not usually lead to earlier remission.
