Though you could get pregnant within 2-4 weeks after abortion, most doctors 
would recommend that you wait until your body has physically recovered. If 
you are preparing for your next pregnancy, it would be recommended for you 
to start taking prenatal vitamins at least a month before attempting to 
conceive. I wish you well, take care.
