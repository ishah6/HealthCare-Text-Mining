If done correctly, drug testing for cocaine is pretty accurate. Most drug 
tests that check for cocaine look for benzoylecgonine, a product of the 
body's metabolism of the drug. That said, some medications and medical 
conditions can sometimes trigger a false positive for cocaine. These 
include:AmoxicillinTopical anesthetics derived from cocaine (does not include lidocaine or 
novocaine)Liver diseaseKidney diseaseDiabetesI would suggest that you speak to your doctor if you are suffering from any 
of the above mentioned issues.
