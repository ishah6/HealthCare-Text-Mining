The long standing oral contrast in the appendix might be the cause of your 
right lower abdominal pain. In my opinion, you may be having an acute 
appendicitis.The diagnostic workup and diagnosis of acute appendicitis will depend on 
the clinical history and physical examination findings. Abdominal CT scan 
has an accuracy of over 90% for acute appendicitis.I would advise you to consult your surgeon on the possibility of 
appendicitis and also rule out other causes that may present with similar 
pain such as pelvic inflammatory disease, ovarian cyst, ectopic pregnancy 
and urinary tract infection.
