at first my period was regular when it stopped altogether i started birth control which comes on time monthly.  the doctor gave me a pill to start it which they could try for you if that dont work the next option they may consider is taking a huge needle to get fluid samples which when i heard that i said no thanks i will get on birth control.  so your best bet is the gyno or reg.physician.  it may just be that you have high testosterone.  many reasons for this, but the more you put it off the more it could actually affect conceiving.
