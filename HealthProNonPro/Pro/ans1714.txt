What you are be experiencing may be due to expectoration of phlegm due to 
respiratory tract infection or a post nasal drip. You may use 
expectorants, mucolytics and steam inhalation to help remove the phlegm 
from the throat.Since the color of your phlegm is white, this indicates that it is not 
infected. However, it is also wise to have yourself checked by a doctor 
just to make sure if you need antibiotics or not.
