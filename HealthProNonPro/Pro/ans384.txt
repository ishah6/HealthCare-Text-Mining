Hyperthyroidism can cause many symptoms including palpitations, heat 
intolerance, loose stools, tiredness, fatigue, increased heart rate, hand 
tremors, weight loss, hair loss and itching skin. If you have symptoms of 
hyperthyroidism, I would suggest that you see your doctor for serum thyroid 
assays for a definitive diagnosis.
