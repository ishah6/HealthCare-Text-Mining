Thank you for your question. We are very concerned with the symptoms you 
are experiencing and we first would like to encourage you to refrain from 
driving until you are adequately evaluated by a doctor. You could be 
experiencing a circulation problem to your brain. This could be caused by a 
weakend heart, or occluded vessels that supply your brain, or can be caused 
by transient ischemic attacks (mini strokes). It is imperative that you 
promptly consult your doctor to be evaluated for any of these as an 
etiology of your symptoms. The earlier you are treated the better the 
outcome of preserving your memory, and reducing your symptoms will be.
