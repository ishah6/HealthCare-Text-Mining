You are most probably suffering from a viral flu. No treatment is needed 
other than tylenol for the fever and headache. The infection should subside 
on its own within 3-4 days. You may also take an NSAIDS for the muscle and 
backaches.If your headache worsens or you develop vomiting, I would then suggest that 
you immediately consult your doctor or go to the ER. I wish you well, take 
care.
