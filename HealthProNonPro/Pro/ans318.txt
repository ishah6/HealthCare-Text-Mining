From the images that you've attached, my opinion is that the skin lesion is 
caused by Pityriasis rosea. The exact cause of pityriasis rosea is unclear, 
although the cause may be a viral infection, however the disease is not 
contagious. Pityriasis rosea typically begins with a large, slightly 
raised, scaly patch and then spreads to the back, chest and abdomen. Most 
cases of Pityriasis rosea need no treatment other than reassurance. However 
if the itching is worrisome, topical corticosteroids can be applied. 
Since pityriasis rosea can look like several other skin diseases, including 
ringworm, Lyme disease, psoriasis and secondary syphilis, I would advise 
that you consult a dermatologist for further evaluation.
