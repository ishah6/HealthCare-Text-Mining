of the face could be due to sinusitis. Sinusitis is caused by viral, 
bacterial or fungal infection of the nasal sinuses. Often there may be a 
collection of mucus that causes a feeling of heaviness of the face and 
headaches.You may need to book an appontment with an otolaryngolosit for further 
evaluation. A CT scan is the most sensitive test to detect sinusitis.
