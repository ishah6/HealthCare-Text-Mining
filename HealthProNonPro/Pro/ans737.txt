It is most probable that the pain you are experiencing could be due to 
epididymitis, a urinary tract infection or ureteric colic due to stone. It 
is difficult for one to tell without examination and tests. Both 
epididymitis and urinary tract infection get better with antibiotics. Renal 
stones on the other-hand may require further evaluation and treatment 
depending on the size of the stone.If you are continuing to have pain even after taking medications, I would 
advise you to setup and appointment with your doctor for a physical and 
lab-work like urinalysis, culture and ultrasound of the kidneys and pelvis.
