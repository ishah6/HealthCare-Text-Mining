There are many causes of itching and id difficult for me to tell what could 
be the cause of itching in your case. Since you have mentioned that your 
girlfriend had developed itching too, my most probable diagnosis would be 
due to a common pathogen such as dust mites, scabies and lice.To identify the cause, you may need to see a dermatologist. Once a cause 
has been identified, treatment may then be given according to the cause. 
Corticosteroid creams and oral antihistamines may help relieve the symptoms 
of itching.
