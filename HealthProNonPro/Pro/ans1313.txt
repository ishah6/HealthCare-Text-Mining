The brown color that you've had when emptying the bladder could be due to 
expulsion of blood and mucus or "show", a sign that your cervix is dilating 
and that you will soon go into labor. The diagnosis of labor is a clinical 
one. Normal labor is deemed to have begun if you are undergoing regular and 
painful contractions, which increase in frequency and intensity over time. 
If your back aches occur at regular interval (two or more spontaneous 
contraction every 15 mins) and increase in intensity, go to the hospital 
for admission.
