Inflammation of the tonsils is caused either by viral or bacterial 
infection. It is important to determine the cause of the tonsillitis before 
treatment. You may need to see your doctor for an examination of the throat 
and swab to rule out streptococcal infection.Since your tonsillitis has been over 3 weeks, you may require antibiotics 
to be taken for at least 10 days. Rest, adequate fluid intake, saline water 
gargles, warm fluids and lozenges may help with symptoms.
