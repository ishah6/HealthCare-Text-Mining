Thank you for your question. This distinct 'fishy' odor could be due to the 
fact you may have an infection with a bacteria called Trichomonas. This 
bacteria is commonly spread by unprotected sexual intercourse, and infects 
women more than men. Your symptoms may be sub-clinical if you are not 
experiencing discharge, burning during urination and pelvic pain. It is also possible that this odor could be caused by a yeast infection. 
Both of these infections require treatment with prescription medication. We 
recommend that you consult your doctor and have STD testing performed to 
determine the cause of this odor. Once treated this odor should resolve 
without complication.Thanks for consulting AskTheDoctor.com.
