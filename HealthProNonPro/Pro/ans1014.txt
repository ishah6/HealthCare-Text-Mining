Problems with thyroid can affect a women's menstrual periods. 
Hypothyroidism can cause a variety of problems such as irregular periods, 
heavy bleeds or loss of periods. When hypothyroidism is severe, it can 
reduce a woman's chances of becoming pregnant. In women who are not 
pregnant, hyperthyroidism can affect menstrual periods too and also make it 
harder for conception. The rick of miscarriage is also higher due to 
hyperthyroidism. Fortunately, there are effective treatments available and 
chances of conception is markedly raised after correction of the problem. I 
hope this answers your question, take care.
