Your foreskin problem could be caused by phimosis or balanitis. Phimosis is 
a common condition in which the foreskin of the penis cannot be pulled 
back. Balanitis is swelling of the foreskin caused by infection. I would 
suggest that you consult your doctor for further management. Treatment of 
phimosis include stretching of the foreskin manually or with balloon 
devices. Steroid creams applied to the area have also shown to help. If 
this does not work then circumcision is the next step in which a slit like 
cut is made to relieve the skin . I hope this help.
