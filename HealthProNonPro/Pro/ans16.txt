A large mole can sometimes lead to anxiety and loss of self confidence in 
an individual. Moles can happen to anyone and there is nothing to feel 
embarrassed about. Moles or nevi are common skin lesions caused by the 
proliferation of pigment cells in the skin called melanocytes. Moles are 
usually benign in nature, however in my opinion it would be good practice 
to get it examined by a dermatologist to rule out malignant melanoma (a 
cancerous form of nevi). A mole may be treated for cosmetic reasons and the 
surgical options are electrosurgery/shave biopsy and excision biopsy, which 
may in some cases leave a scar. I would suggest that you consult a 
dermatologist to get the mole examined.
