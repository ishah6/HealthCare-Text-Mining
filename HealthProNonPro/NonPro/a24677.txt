Cancer totally sucks.  But if you have true friends, they will stand by you when you are going through your treatments.  When I was going through my cancer, I definitely knew who was my true friend and who wasnt, I quickly dropped the people who werent my friends.

I was open and honest with people, I think thats the best way to be in life.  :)
