Thank you for your question. Based on your description alone we cannot be 
certain that this could be an infection of tinea corporis (ring worm). This 
infection is caused by a fungus which infects the skin forming a 
characteristic ring shaped red, itchy infection. It usually responds very 
well to over the counter topical antifungal creams. It is also possible that this could be an insect bite. What concerns is is 
that a circular insect bite could be caused by a dear tick. These are 
insects that feed on the blood of mammals and in doing so, infect the house 
with a bacteria which causes lyme disease. If left untreated, it can affect 
the central nervous system leading to muscle weakness, and even paralysis.We recommend that you have this examined by your doctor. Most likely it is 
simple a fungal skin rash. If it is lyme disease, you will need to start a 
course of antibiotics which will clear this infection. The earlier you do 
this the better the outcome.
