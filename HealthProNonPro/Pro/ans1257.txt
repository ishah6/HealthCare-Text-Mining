Thank you for your question. This could be hyperpigmentation caused by 
hormonal fluctuations, sun exposure, or complications associated with 
diabetes. Now skin lightening creams may reduce the appearance of this but 
this can be dangerous as they can cause skin damage if used excessively. We 
do recommend that you consult your doctor to have blood work done to 
determine if you are suffering from any endocrinological problem leading to 
your facial hyperpigmentation. If this is ruled out then you may need to 
consult a dermatologist to investigate possible causes for your symptoms.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
