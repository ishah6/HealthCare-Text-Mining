It is recommended additional imaging studies if you are having symptoms 
that may be due to a whiplash injury. The severity of the trauma often not 
correlated with the seriousness of the clinical problems. A history of neck 
injury is a significant risk factor for chronic neck pain. Other 
complications besides the pain include: spinal cord compression, strains 
or tears of the anterior spinal ligaments, shoulder pain, muscular weakness 
of the arms. I would advise you to get an evaluation with a specialist in 
Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (Physiatrist) if later on you start 
having symptoms, in order to rule out a possible nerve-muscle problem 
consequence of the same issue and at the same time have physical therapy .
