I do understand your concern after getting bitten by a dog. An important 
aspect is to rule out a rabies infection. As a doctor it is important to 
know the immunization status of the dog, the victim as well as the site of 
injury.My advise is that you get yourself examined by your doctor. Vaccination 
against rabies or antibiotics may be necessary after a complete physical 
and history.
