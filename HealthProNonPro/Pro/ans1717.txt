What you are experiencing is breakthrough bleeding which is normal if one 
stops taking contraceptives midway. This is normal and is due to decreased 
level of hormones after stopping the contraceptives. If the bleeding 
continues into the next cycle, I would suggest that you consult your doctor 
then.
