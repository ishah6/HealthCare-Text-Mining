Your description is very scant and the other symptoms accompanying the back 
pain are very vague. In your case, a nerve compression at the level of the 
spine must be ruled out, this might be caused by a degenerative process or 
a bulging disk at lumbar spine level, and you can feel it worst in some 
positions because in certain positions the intervertebral space gets 
smaller and compress the correspondent nerve. The pain can radiate to the 
upper thigh, genital area, and leg or even to the foot depending of the 
lumbar segment involved. In order to confirm this diagnostic impression, 
the best imaging study is the MRI. Basically the conservative treatment is 
Physical Therapy aimed to recondition and stabilize the lumbar spine by 
re-educating you, teaching you a daily stretching routine for the lumbar 
area, strengthening of abdominal muscles, and other important general 
recommendations as follows: lose weight, sleeping with a pillow between the 
knees lying on the side, avoid activities that place additional strain on 
the lumbar spine (example: weight lifting). All of the above, with the 
objective to keep you as far as possible from episodes of acute low back 
pain, and also to preserve your quality of life. If the conservative 
measures do not seem to work, the local corticosteroid injection may be 
considered.
