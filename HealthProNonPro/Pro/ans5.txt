A CAT scan during pregnancy does involve a potential risk to the developing 
fetus. A CT scan involves exposure of the fetus to levels that are slightly 
higher than normal x-rays. The radiation received from a CT is about 10mSv. 
In, general CT scans are not recommended in pregnancy unless the benefits 
of the CT clearly outweigh the potential risks.
