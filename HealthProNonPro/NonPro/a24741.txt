Diets aids are a scam. Period. If you want to loose weight you are going to have bite the bullet and accept the fact that you need to change your lifestlye. Not go on a diet, not take a pill, not supplements, not excersise machines on tv or any of the other products which are marketed to take advantage of people who do what to do it the right way. Nothing will take off weight and keep it off other than eating a healthy diet day in and day out. (Read the USDA food prymiad if you dont have a meal plan) and do excercise 30 minutes a day. Period. It might not be easy at first but it is very simple.
