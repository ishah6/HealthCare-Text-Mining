The car accidents usually produce pain in neck-shoulder-arm, known as a 
Whiplash injury (cervical acceleration-deceleration) which is one of the 
most common cause of cervical strain and also one of the most common 
sequels of nonfatal car injuries. The severity of the trauma often not 
correlated with the seriousness of the clinical problems. Other 
complications besides the pain include: spinal cord compression, strains or 
tears of the anterior spinal ligaments, shoulder pain, muscular weakness of 
the arms. It is not likely that your FAI was caused by the car accident.
