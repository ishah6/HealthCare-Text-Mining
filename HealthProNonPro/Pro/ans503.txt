I do understand your concern. It is not easy to see your child suffer from 
recurrent infections and yet not have a definite diagnosis. The recurrent 
infections may be suggestion of underlying asthma, congenital heart disease 
or an immuno-compromised state leading to recurrent infections. Your 
pediatrician may have to run further test to determine the cause of the 
recurrent infections.
