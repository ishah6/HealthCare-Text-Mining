You are most probably suffering from seborrheic dermatitis. This is a 
common skin disorder that mainly affects your scalp, causing scaly, itchy, 
red skin and stubborn dandruff. Seborrheic dermatitis is thought to be due 
to a combination of an over production of skin oil and irritation from a 
yeast called malessizia.Commonly affected areas include the scalp, eyebrows, eyelids, creases of 
the nose, lips, behind the ears, in the outer ear, and middle of the chest. 
It can be uncomfortable and cause embarrassment when it develops on visible 
parts of your body.There is no definitive treatment for seborrheic dermatitis. the mainstay of 
treatments are :i) Anti fungal creams, lotions and shampoos like ketoconazole, ciclopirox 
and terbinafine.ii) Corticosteroids : hydrocortisone 1% cream, desonide and betamethasone.iii) Calcineurin inhibitors lower the activity of your immune system and 
decrease the flare up of the disease.Seborrheic dermatitis is a chronic (life-long) condition that can be 
controlled with treatment. It is important that you pay attention to skin 
care.
