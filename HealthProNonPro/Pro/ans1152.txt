Thank you for your question. If you were to select a non-toxic paint there 
is still a possibility to develop irritation of the sensitive skin of the 
genital area. Non-toxic water colours may not be poisonous if ingested, 
however, the actual pigments can irritate the skin. We would not be 
concerned if this was done once and a while, however if you were to engage 
in this type of artistic work daily, you could potentially be at risk for 
irritating the sensitive skin of the genital area.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com for your medical question.
