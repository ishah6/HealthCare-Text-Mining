Pain during intercourse or dyspareunia may cause concern to many. There 
could be many causes of dyspareunia : urinary tract infection/urethritis, 
vaginismus (spasms of the vaginal muscles), vaginal strictures, 
interstitial cystitis, endometriosis and vulvovaginitis all can cause pain 
during intercourse. I would advise you to see your doctor for blood-work 
for infections, urinalysis and pelvic ultrasound if needed. Treatment 
depends on the cause, with infections treated with appropriate antibiotics.
