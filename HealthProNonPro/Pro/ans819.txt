Knee pain is the most common presentation of patellofemoral syndrome The 
pain typically is located behind/below /around the kneecap and often shows 
during activities that require knee flexion and forceful contraction of the 
quadriceps (ei, during squats, bicycle, ascending/descending stairs, 
jogging or pendants, prolonged kneeling). Pain may be worsen by sitting 
with the knee flexed for a long period of time, such as while watching a 
movie, hence leading to the terms "theatre sign" and "movie-goer's knee." 
The causes are diverse: Overuse (repetitive use or activity), overloading, 
and misuse of the patellofemoral joint. The suggested strategy for 
conservative treatment should be as follows: Physical therapy program 
(exercises and pain control with TENS, ultrasound, ice packs after 
exercises), anti-inflammatory medication (i.e.: “Aleve”, “Advil”), 
education so you understand which activities avoid because those can 
aggravate patellofemoral syndrome. Also, and very important, remark the 
need for extended adherence to the exercise regimen. The physical therapist 
should educate you about a home exercise program. Allow time for these 
conservative measures (ei: exercise program) to have an effect, usually 4-6 
weeks is adequate for some resolution of symptoms.
