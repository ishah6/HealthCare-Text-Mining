I do understand your concern about your infrequent periods. The possible 
causes could be due to stress or caloric deprivation. I would advise you to 
observe your periods and if they continue to be irregular, I would 
recommend that you see your doctor to rule out any underlying pathology. 
Treatment will depend on the cause, take care.
