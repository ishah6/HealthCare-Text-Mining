I do understand your concern about body hair removal. I would not advise 
you to take estrogen for the removal of body and facial hair. Other safer 
common hair removal options are :i) Laser treatment - is a short procedure (usually 30 mins) and is best for 
removing the hair from the chest, back and shoulder area. The results are 
almost permanent though 6-8 treatment may be needed.ii) Electrolysis : Because of the time consuming nature of the procedure, 
it is usually preferred fro the removal of hair from the brow and neck.iii) Waxing : This is preferred for hair in the brow, neck , ears, legs and 
arms. The only downside is that the procedure may be painful.iv) Shaving : Straight shavers may be used for areas of the back and 
shoulders during a shower. The result is permanent and may last a few days.v) Depilatories or cream hair removers : Cream or gel based suspension 
dissolves the hair protein and loosens them. It is preferred for the back, 
chest, arms and legs. The result hair loss may last a couple of weeks.You may want ot consult your dermtologist for treatment options that may be 
suitable for you. Take care.
