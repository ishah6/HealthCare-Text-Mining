Shame that you are not satisified with who you really are.  If you believe in random events, you probably feel screwed by the height fairy.  If you believe that everything has meaning and purpose (even if you do not understand) then become more aware of who you are and what you should be doing.  There is probably a 22 year old female who is only 5 feet tall and wondering where you are.
