read about vitamin B-17   (not b12 or b or bcomplex)

vitamin B17  

doctors can lose their lisence for telling you about it.  it is not available in the USA or in the British colonies.

cancer is like scurvy was the cure for scurvy is vitamin c because it is a vitamin c deficiency it took the medical comunity over 200 years of knowing what the cure was before they admitted it


cancer is a vitamin b17 deficiency the fda and the pharmasuticles companies will slander b17 because it is all natural so they cannot patent it and make lots of money on it    

also they have no intrest in CURING an illness thats why they call it a treatment  the pharmasuticles companies are out to make money they want to give somone 100 pills at 100 dollars a pop and keep them sick as long as they can to make money rather than give someone 1 pill or 10 pills that they cant pattent and sell however they want that will cure a person

the pharmasudical cos cant make money if people arent sick therefore they pressure the fda and doctors to use manufactured crap 90%of which will destroy your liver
