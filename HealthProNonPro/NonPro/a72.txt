"Why" is the big question.  I noticed that at age 35 I began to experience an allergic reaction to melons, bananas, raw carrots and a few other foods.  It is quite frustrating because I have enjoyed those foods my entire life...until now.  I went to my allergist, who is one of the leading asthma and allergy doctors in the country.  He said that is is, unfortately, common for adults to develop new allergies at different points in life.  The big question is "why", and at this point, doctors have no idea why some people develop new allergies and others do not.
