Though there is no such thing as 100% protection, Leven ED (Levonorgestrel 
150mcg and Ethinylestradiol 30mcg), is a very effective contraceptive pill 
if taken correctly. It can be 99% effective in preventing pregnancy and 
coupled with condoms pregnancy is very unlikely. I hope this answers your 
question, I wish you well, take care.
