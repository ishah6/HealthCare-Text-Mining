Smell in the urine may be due to a urinary infection of may indicate the 
presence of sugars in the urine. There is a high risk for developing both 
these conditions when suffering form diabetes. I would suggest that you 
consult your doctor for a urinalysis, kidney function tests and blood 
glucose levels to see how effectively your sugars are controlled and test 
for underlying urinary infection.
