The headache you've experienced could be a migraine brought on by sexual 
activity. Most headaches during sex are nothing to worry about. But some 
can be a sign of something serious, such as problems with the blood vessels 
that feed your brain. You may need to consult your doctor for further 
investigations like MRI, CT and cerebral angiogram to rule out any serious 
underlying problems.
