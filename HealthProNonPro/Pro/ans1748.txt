Yeast infections are a caused by a fungus called Candida albicans. Yeast 
infection is common in men who are immune compromised, are on prolonged 
antibiotics or have diabetes.The symptoms you have mentioned do suggest of an immuno-compromised state 
but would require blood tests to be sure. I would suggest that your 
boyfriend talk to his doctor regarding his symptoms. It is important for 
you to use condoms during sex at this time till the tests have been bone 
and the treatment started.
