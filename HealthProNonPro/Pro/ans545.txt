I may be difficult to say what is the cause of your leg pain. It may be 
caused due to osteoarthritis, musculo-skeletal strain, nerve entrapment and 
trauma. Treatment would involve trying to keep a proper posture, avoiding 
repetitive cervical and lumbosacral stress (example weight lifting), 
adhering to a healthy lifestyle and proper nutrition, light physical 
activity, losing excess of weight, smoking cessation, seeking medical 
advice in a timely manner when indicated.
