Sounds like you only have problems when hes drinking.  My marriage was in trouble because of my drinking.  My wife told me to choose between her and drinking.  It was really that bad.  I stopped and weve had a wonderful marriage since.  I must warn you though, if you bring up his drinking he WILL get mad, but you must think of yourself in this situation.  Good luck, truly.
