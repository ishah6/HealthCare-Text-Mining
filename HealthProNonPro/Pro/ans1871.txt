Your wrist pain could be caused by carpal tunnel syndrome or tenosynovitis. 
Both these conditions are treated conservatively. If this conservative 
treatment fails then the surgical option is employed. Conservative 
treatment involves the use of splints, pain medication, injection 
corticosteroids and physical therapy. Your doctor may be able to diagnose 
the problem with physical examination. An x-ray may be normal in most of 
the cases.
