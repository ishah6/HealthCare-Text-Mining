Thank you for your question. There is no medically recommended way to 
administer the depo-provera contraceptive injection outside of its 
medically approved indications. You may benefit from using an alternative 
form of contraception such as the oral contraceptive birth control pill, if 
you will be away for an extended period of time, without access to your 
doctor.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
