According to your description you may be experiencing a Calf Tendinitis. 
The calf muscle is made up of three muscles located in the back of the leg. 
The two heads of the gastrocnemeius and the soleus, these three muscles end 
in a common tendon: the Achilles tendon. Usually the complain is a sharp 
intense pain after a sudden or straining move.I suggest treat it as any 
tendinitis, meaning: avoid any activities that exacerbate the pain, apply 
ice locally during the early phase and moist heat during the long-term 
phase. Use of anti inflammatory medication NSAIDs (“aleve”, “motrin”) can 
help to ease pain and swelling. The healing time is different for each 
individual in particular, but if you see no improvement over 2-4 weeks with 
these conservative measures, I strongly recommend a reevaluation to rule 
out some other conditions or factors that may be causing your symptoms.
