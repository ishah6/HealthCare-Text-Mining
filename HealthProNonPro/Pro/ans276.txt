Esophageal varices are dilated, tortuous veins within the wall of the 
esophagus. They are most commonly seen in patients with chronic liver 
disease that has led of cirrhosis and subsequent portal hypertension. 
Massive varices may bleed, causing severe hemorrhage, a life threatening 
complication. Grade 2 varices are enlarged, tortuous esophageal varices 
occupying less than one third of the lumen. Currently, prevention of 
variceal bleeding is by using non selective beta blockers to reduce 
splanchnic blood flow and portal pressure. Foe those who cannot tolerate 
beta blockers or in whom they are contraindicated, Endoscopic Band Ligation 
(EBL) is performed.
