The symptoms that you have described of lower right abdominal pain, suggest 
that you are probably suffering from acute appendicitis, intestinal colic 
or a ureteric colic. If the pain does not resolve on its own or becomes 
more severe and/or other symptoms develop (fever, vomiting, etc), then you 
should seek medical opinion.
