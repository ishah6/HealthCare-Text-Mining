I do understand that you would like information regarding your appendectomy 
surgery. Before going into the details of the surgery I would like to 
explain you a little about the appendix.The appendix is a tube-like structure that is located at the junction of 
the small and large intestines and is located in the right lower quadrant 
of the abdomen. It is usually about 10cm long and is a vestigial organ 
(performs no function). Appendicitis is caused when there is inflammation 
of the appendix due to collection of food material and bacterial infection.In a laparoscopic appendectomy, port placement depends on the surgeon. In 
women due to cosmetic concerns, the laparoscopic ports are usually placed 
lower in the abdomen and sometimes only two ports are used. In a two port 
procedure, one port is palaced below the umbilicus and the other at the 
left lower lower quadrant of the abdomen. The surgical clip that is present 
in the right lower abdomen, is the clip that was used to clamp the opening 
of the appendix after it was removed. The clip will cause no complications. 
I hope I have been able to answer your question, take care.
