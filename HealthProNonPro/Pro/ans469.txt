I do understand your concern, although a PAP smear may sound invasive and 
uncomfortable procedure. The truth is that it is a simple, quick, and 
relatively painless screening test. Most women do not experience pain as a 
side effect of a Pap smear. Any pain or cramp experienced is temporary and 
is relieved as soon as the procedure is over. I would advise you to speak 
with someone who has already had the smear to better understand what they 
experienced during the examination.
