Photoepilation is one method of treatment for unwanted body hair. This 
procedure uses an intense pulsed light to destroy hair follicles. Though 
photoepilation is contraindicated in active or chronic herpes infections, 
pretreatment with antiretroviral drugs can be done 1 day prior to 
photoepilation and continued for a total of 6-7 days. I hope the 
information helps, take care.
