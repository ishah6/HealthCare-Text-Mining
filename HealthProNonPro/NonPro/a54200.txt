Look at your Moms feet....If they look like she is wearing fishermans boots,  Your done.  If they look like bunny feet, you have time to grow....Besides, girl,  smaller women seem to be the most beautiful.....Barbra Mandrel, Dolly Patron, and that little girl that I knew next door in Baltimore, named Toni....Never forgot her.
