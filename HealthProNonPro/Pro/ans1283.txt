Thank you for your question. What you have described seems to be a yeast 
infection. It may not have adequately responded to the three day antifungal 
treatment which you tried. However, we recommend that you have your doctor 
examine this rash as well as take a sample of the discharge to be tested 
for the causative agent of this infection. It is possible that you will 
need a stronger prescription anti-fungal cream along with oral medication, 
for a longer course, to treat this adequately. Furthermore, the vaginal 
dryness you are experiencing is likely due to this yeast infection. It will 
likely resolve without complication after you are treated. Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
