Your chest pain could be the result of pleuritis due to the viral 
infection. Pleuritis is an inflammation of the parietal and serous pleura 
of the lung. Viral pleurisy is a common cause of pleuritic chest pain in 
young adults. Viral infections normally run their course and no medications 
are required. Anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen can be taken to 
relieve the pain. However if you notice that the pain is worsening or you 
have difficulty breathing, I would suggest that you contact your doctor 
immediately or go to the ER. Take care.
