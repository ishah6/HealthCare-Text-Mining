There may be many causes as to why you are spotting. This could be due to 
an underlying hormonal imbalance or due to other causes on irregular 
menstruation like PCOS, thyroid issues, an anovulatory cycle, infections of 
the tract or could be pregnancy related like ectopic pregnancy, missed 
abortion, or an implantation bleed. I would highly advice you take a 
pregnancy test so as to rule out this possibility and consult your 
physician for further investigations and follow up.
