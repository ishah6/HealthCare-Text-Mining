The most probable cause of the bump could be due to scar tissue that was 
caused due to an inflammatory reaction in the skin. The condition does not 
require any treatment other than to wait and watch. If the lump is growing 
in size or becomes tender, you may have to visit your doctor to rule out an 
abscess.
