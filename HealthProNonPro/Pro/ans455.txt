I do understand your concern for your daughter's health. Acute gastritis 
covers a broad spectrum of entities and is difficult to diagnose. There 
could be a number of causes of acute gastritis : drugs, bacterial, viral or 
fungal infections, acute stress and food allergy all may cause gastritis.There is no specific treatment for gastritis. Usually antacids, H2 blockers 
and proton pump inhibitors are the first line drugs given in the treatment 
of gastritis. Since the symptoms of pain have not resolved even with 
medication, I would suggest that you consult your daughter's doctor on the 
benefits of antibiotic treatment.H. pylori is the most common cause of gastritis. Eradication of the 
infection improves symptoms including dyspepsia, gastritis and peptic 
ulcers. Diagnosis of infection is usually made with a blood antibody test 
or a rapid urease test.
