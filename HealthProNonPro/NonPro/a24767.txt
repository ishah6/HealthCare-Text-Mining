I do know that the first person who went over Niagara Falls in a barrel (she went with a big mattress and her cat) was a teacher who was so stressed from teaching that she thought she thought she could make money from lecturing about her experience and not have to teach any more.

She survived and did some lectures, but made more money selling pieces from the barrel (and probably a few barrels she didnt use).  

Have you ever seen Niagara Falls?  To be willing to risk your life going over it in a barrel just to stop teaching, has to be some very high kind of stress level.
