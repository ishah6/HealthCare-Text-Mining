I wish I could say I didnt see weight when I am looking at others, but its part of the visual and with some -kinda hard to miss. HOWever... if they have a vibrant personality or a brilliant smile or a fantastic laugh coupled with a great sense of humor, I can absolutely find them attractive.
Plus add a smooth bass or a gravelly baritone voice and Ill be melting.
