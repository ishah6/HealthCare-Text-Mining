Warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and is extremely common in 
young adults. Common warts can be contagious and can spread through cuts in 
the skin or walking barefoot in public areas. Many common warts don't 
require treatment, they usually disappear on their own. Salicylic acid, an 
over the counter medication can be used. You could also see your doctor for 
using liquid nitrogen therapy. Most warts may recur and may require 
multiple therapy sitting.
