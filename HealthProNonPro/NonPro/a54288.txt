Sorry, there is no say way to take off that much weight in 4 weeks.   Thats a crash diet and the weight you take off will come back faster then you can blink an eye and maybe a few more pounds to boot.   
  I would suggest talking with your doctor about beginning an exercises program and diet, maybe realistic goals of 2lbs a week.  Stick with it and make it part of your life, maybe youll find that in a year of so youve found the person your looking for?   These things have to be for life, not just for 20 pounds and back to your old ways.   Good luck
