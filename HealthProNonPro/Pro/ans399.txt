I do appreciate your concern regarding the health of your students. It is 
very difficult for me to say what could be causing your students movements. 
Hyperkinetic movements disorders in children are characterized by abnormal 
involuntary movement. Diagnosis of the specific condition depends primarily 
upon careful observation of the clinical features. Tics are the most common 
hyperkinetic disorder in children. Dystonia, stereotypies, choreoathetosis, 
tremors, and myoclonus also occur but are less common.I would advise that you speak to both the parents regarding your concerns 
and advise that they take the child for further evaluation to a 
pediatrician. However in case they do not regard the symptoms as serious, 
you may consult your school board or an ethics committee as to the next 
step. I hope this helps.
