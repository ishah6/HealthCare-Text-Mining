Susceptability to disease is the result of genetic defect caused by the sin of the first man Adam.  He handed down that defect so that all men suffer disease and eventually die.  God has provided a way for us to eventually be released from disease, suffering and death.  You can read about it at John, chapter 17, verse 3 and John, chapter 3, verse 16.
