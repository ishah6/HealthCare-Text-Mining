The multiple joints pain may have several causes, for example: 
inflammatory diseases (rheumatoid arthritis), autoimmune issues 
(scleroderma, lupus), osteopenia (low calcium in the bones), metabolic 
diseases (high cholesterol, gout, parathyroid problems), muscle problems 
(polymyositis), once that you rule out all the mentioned causes and in the 
view that you are young and active, it would be important rule out possibly 
a fibromyalgia. I strongly recommend you to have a consultation with a 
specialist: Rheumatologist, who will evaluate you and will order the 
appropriate lab test and possibly other tests that may involve 
determination of muscle electrical activity or/and skin tests.
