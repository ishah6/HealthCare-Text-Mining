Blood in the semen (hematospermia) causes concern for most men. It is 
actually a fairly common occurrence in men of all ages. There are number of 
causes, most of which are insignificant. Prostate infections, direct trauma 
to the prostate, infections of the urethra (tubular structure which carries 
urine and semen), some sexually transmitted diseases, bleeding disorders 
and diseases of the seminal vesicles, all can cause blood in the semen. Most cases of blood in the semen may resolve on their own but may require 
investigations and a visit to the urologist if bleeding is consistent.
