I would say it depends on how badly it is affecting your ability to work. Ive heard it said and believe it is true that people can fake crazy and get ssi easier than people with rare conditions and back problems.

PKU is something a lot of people dont know a lot about and I have just recently discovered more about it than I ever knew. I never understood how many physical problems are possible with this condition.

SSI judges tend to be very critical. What I understand about ssi cases is the documentation should be very complete, explaining every little detail that causes you the inability to work. If you have to go to see the judge, have someone else open the door for you and just have total pain that day (no pain pills even if you need them).
