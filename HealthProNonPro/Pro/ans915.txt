Most women have breast tenderness or mastalgia which may or may not follow 
a pattern. A cyclical pattern of pain may be due to hormonal changes and is 
more during the menstrual period. Non-cyclical pain often occurs in a 
single breast and may be due to fibroadenoma or a breast cyst.You have mentioned that you palpated a lump in the right breast. Although 
it is most probably caused by a fibrocystic breast disease, I would advise 
you to consult your doctor for further evaluation. You may be able to 
relieve breast pain by using nonprescription medicines.
