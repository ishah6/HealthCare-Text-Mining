Drink a glass of water from the other edge:

1)put your lips on the far edge of the glass of water (you chin should be in the mouth of the glass and the side you normally drink from will be near your neck.

2)bend forward at the waist and tip your head down to the ground.

3)Drink the whole glass. (your chin may get slightly wet the first time you do this if you drink too fast)

100% success rate ever since Ive learned this.
