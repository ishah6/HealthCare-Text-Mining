Thank you for your question. It is your choice to elect to have surgery in 
a foreign country but whether or not you will require chemotherapy depend 
on how severe your cervical cancer is and if there is any spread of the 
cancer to other parts of your body. If you choose to have surgery abroad, 
it will be wise to return with your entire medical report on your surgery, 
the pathological report with your cancer staging, and recommendations of 
your medical team in your foreign country to assist your physician in 
providing you with the best management of your disease.
