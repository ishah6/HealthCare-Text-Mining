You cant and stay healthy.  Really the only way to do that would be to starve yourself, and when you starve yourself your body doesnt eat your fat, it eats your muscle and you may never be able to rebuild it again.  I lost 82 pounds in a year and a half.  If you do things right, you can lose 3 pounds in a week.  First, you want to start walking every day.  I didnt say exercise really hard, just walking.  An hour, hour and a half, every day.  Then, you have to start looking at what youre eating.  Dont eat that candy.  Leave one day out of the week for candy.  Dont drink that soda; if youre addicted to caffeine, switch to tea (I recommend Earl Gray).  Switch from pork and beef to grilled chicken (not breaded) and fish.  Avoid things like potatoes and corn.  Theyre too starchy.  Try colored veggies like carrots.  Replace candy with fruit.  E-mail me and Ill give you a run-down of a good way to lose weight.
