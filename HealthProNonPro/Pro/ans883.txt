Most cases of acute gastroenteritis (stomach flu) are caused by viral 
infection. This condition is usually self limiting and runs its own course. 
Treatment involves oral re-hydration therapy with fluid and electrolyte 
solutions which are available in most drug-stores. Since your mother has 
associated cardiac problems, I would advise that you take her to see a 
doctor. It is essential to rule out a heart attack as the cause of 
vomiting. Over the counter anti emetics like gravol may be given but will 
be only available through a prescription by her doctor. I hope this answers 
your question, take care.
