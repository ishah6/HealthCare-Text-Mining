Oral contraceptive pills are widely used and are generally safe and 
effective for many women. The choice of pill formulation is generally 
influenced by clinical considerations. When switinching from Yaz to 
Tricyclen Lo, you simply start your new pack of Tricyclen pills the next 
day after you take your last 'inactive' pill of Yaz. If you follow these 
instructions carefully, you should not have to use a back-up method of 
birth control. However, if seven days have passed since your last active 
birth control pill, you will need to use back-up contraception for the 
first seven days of your new pill's active cycle.
