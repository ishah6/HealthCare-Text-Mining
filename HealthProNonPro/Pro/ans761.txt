It is possible that what you're experiencing is a migraine episode. These 
headaches are due to changes in the brain and surrounding blood vessels. 
Migraine headaches typically last from 4-72 hours and vary in frequency 
from daily to less than 1 per year. The headaches are usually preceded or 
accompanied by warning symptoms (Auras), flashes of light, blind spots or 
tingling in arms and/or legs, nausea, vomiting, hypersensitivity to light 
and sound. Fatigue and muscle tension are also common. I suggest that you 
get an evaluation by a neurologist in order to determine the best treatment 
option which includes medications (pain-relieving and preventive), 
lifestyle changes that can help ease the pain (muscle relaxation, 
meditation, yoga, get enough sleep, avoid wine, chocolate and cheeses).
