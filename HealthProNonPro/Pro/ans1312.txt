The blood in stool could be due to hemorrhoid or an anal fissure. 
Hemorrhoids are very often seen during pregnancy and the growing uterus 
compresses on the abdominal vessels. The primary step in the management of 
hemorrhoids are lifestyle modification such as increased fiber in diet and 
adequate hydration. Sometimes over the counter analgesic creams and 
ointment containing hydrocotisone can be applied to relieve the symptoms ( 
these should not be used more than a week). If the bleeding is persistent 
treatment available are rubber band ligation, 
sclerotherapy, hemorrhoidectomy and hemorrhoid stapling.
