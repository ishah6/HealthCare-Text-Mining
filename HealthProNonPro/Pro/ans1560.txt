There are two types of Herpes Virus : Herpesvirus type 1 (HSV-1), which is 
transmitted primarily by contact with infected saliva and Herpesvirus type 
2 (HSV-2) which is usually sexually transmitted. So if your boyfriend had 
HSV 1 then there may be a risk of you getting the infection. It is unlikely 
that you would get HSV 2 infection though.
