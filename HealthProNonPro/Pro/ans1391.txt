The most common cause of forgetfulness in your age group is stress. I would 
advise that you modify certain aspects of your lifestyle that try to reduce 
stress. Eating a healthy balanced diet, yoga, light music and regular 
exercise will help you. You can also try taking multivitamin to supplement 
certain vitamins that may be absent in your diet.I wish you well, take care.
