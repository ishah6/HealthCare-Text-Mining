Thank you for your question. There is a very low risk of impregnation in 
this encounter however it is still possible. Furthermore, your partner took 
emergency contraceptive medication after 48 hours of this unprotected 
sexual contact, which reduces its efficacy greatly. We recommend that she 
await the commencement of her monthly menstrual period. Should she be late, 
or her period is absent, we recommend that conduct a pregnancy test with 
her doctor to be certain whether or not she has become pregnant. Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
