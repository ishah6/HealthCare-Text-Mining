Thank you for your question. It is possible that your symptoms may not be 
due to a medically related condition but rather the remnants of food 
particles within your oropharynx and your tongue. If you haven tried 
thoroughly brushing and flossing you teeth, washing your mouth, and 
scraping your tongue in an attempt to remove this taste, we recommend that 
you do so.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
