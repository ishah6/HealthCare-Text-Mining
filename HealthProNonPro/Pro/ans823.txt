Let me reassure you that swollen lymph nodes in the neck are most commonly 
caused as a reaction to upper respiratory infections. It is not uncommon 
for lymph nodes in the neck to become swollen when there is an infection in 
the airways. The swelling usually resolves shortly after the infection 
resolves. However, without an examination of the neck, I cannot be sure 
that you have a swollen lymph node. Swelling of lymph nodes from bacterial 
or viral infections can last up to 3 weeks. If the swelling persists beyond 
that, it is advisable to see your doctor for consideration of imaging of 
the lymph node or possible blood work to rule out lymphoma.
