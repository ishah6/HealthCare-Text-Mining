Certain studies have found that there is an increased risk of spontaneous 
abortions in women who work with nitrous oxide for 3 or more hours per week

in offices where scavenging equipment is used. Scavenging equipment appears 
to be important in protecting the reproductive health of women working with 
nitrous oxide.
