Most of clavicle fractures have been considered best treated 
nonoperatively, with good outcomes. Management typically included the use 
of either a shoulder sling or a figure-of-eight brace. The vast majority of 
these fractures healed, with variable cosmetic deformity. When a midshaft 
clavicle fracture requires surgical fixation, there are 2 methods of 
fixation that are commonly performed. Both methods involve open reduction 
of the fracture, followed by either insertion of an intramedullary device 
or fixation with a plate and screws Much controversy exists regarding the 
appropriate management of fractures of the distal third of the clavicle. 
Incidence of nonunion of displaced distal third fractures is high, and 
current recommendations are to fix these injuries surgically. Maybe this is 
your case. Recommendations for postoperative management of clavicle 
fractures consists of sling support for 2-4 weeks. During this time, the 
patient performs active range of motion exercises of the elbow and hand and 
pendulum exercises for shoulder motion. At about 2 weeks, the patient may 
begin low impact activities. After 3-4 weeks, the patient begins assisted 
range of motion of the shoulder and progresses to active range of motion as 
tolerated.
