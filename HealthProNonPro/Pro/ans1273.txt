Thank you for your question. We appreciate your concern. Yes steroid 
ophthalmic drops can be prescribed to treat hordeola (styes). It is 
important to follow the prescription as directed according to your doctor's 
instructions. Do no use them beyond the indicated prescription duration. If 
your stye does not resolve, it may require a more invasive treatment such 
as surgical excision. If you notice any changes in vision such as 
blurriness, double vision, decreased clarity, or you develop pain or 
irritation of the eyeball, please discontinue this medication immediately 
and see your doctor as soon as you can.AskTheDoctor.com wishes you a speedy recovery.
