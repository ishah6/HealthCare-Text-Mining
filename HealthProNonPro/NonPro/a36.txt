Lets be honest, in todays world, concentration is hard to come by. What I do is take something that helps me focus on what I need to get done. Have had the this re-occurring loss of focus problem this year and really started looking into natural ways of taking care of it. 

Found this natural supplement on amazon called instant att and it really holds up its end of the bargain. Im focused on my work, no thoughts about social media updates or checking twitter. Really been happy with it so far.
