The hot hands could be due to perimenopausal symptoms or due to 
hyperthyroidism. In either case, I would advise that you consult your 
doctor for further evaluation. Your doctor may need o do a general physical 
examination and thyroid tests to confirm the diagnosis. Treatment will 
depend on the cause. I hope this helps, I wish you well.
