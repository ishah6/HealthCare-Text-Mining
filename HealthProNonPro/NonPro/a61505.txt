I know a selfish lush when I see one.Your boy has a drinking problem and wont face up to it.When he went limp the first time it ws probably from the alcohol and must have caused him some anxiety, then he yells at you and blames you,for his inadequecy.The pattern repeats and gets more physical and mean each time.It will get worse if he does not get help.I understand his frustration,but it is the alcohol that is the cause not you.
If this continues you will be in an abusive relationship in no time.Do you want that for yourself?You can get guidence by looking in the phone book for help in your area.
