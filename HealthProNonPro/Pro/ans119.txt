Asthma causes shortness of breath (dyspnea), but is unlikely in your case. 
Your symptoms of shortness of breath may be related to your respiratory 
tract infection. If antibiotics and rest do not lessen the symptoms of 
breathlessness, you may need to see your doctor. Acute coronary syndrome, 
COPD, congestive heart failure, pneumonia and anemia may also cause similar 
symptoms.Evaluation of the dyspnea will require blood tests like a complete blood 
count, a chest x- ray or CT, spirometry, and allergic testing. Treatment 
will depend on the underling cause of dyspnea.
