I realize how worried you are about your condition. Your symptoms could be 
caused due irritable bowel syndrome. Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a 
common disorder that affects the large intestines and causes cramping, 
abdominal pain, bloating gas, diarrhea and constipation. Because it's not 
clear what causes irritable bowel syndrome, treatment focuses on the relief 
of symptoms. I would suggest that you increase the fiber content in your 
diet, fiber supplements such as psyllium (Metamucil) or methylcellulose 
(Citrucel), with fluids may help. Eliminating high-gas foods like 
carbonated beverages, salads, raw fruits and vegetables — especially 
cabbage, broccoli and cauliflower can be done. More sever symptoms may 
require anticholinergic medications and antidepressants.
