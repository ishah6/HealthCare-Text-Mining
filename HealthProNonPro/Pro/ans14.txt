A hemoglobin level less than 13 mg/dl usually indicates iron deficiency 
anemia in males. The causes of iron deficiency anemia could be due to a 
lack of iron in the diet, blood loss from sources in the body such as a 
peptic ulcer, polyp or in rare cases tumors of the intestines.I would suggest that you take iron supplements and eat foods rich in iron 
such as chicken, lentils, fish, meat, whole gain bread, spinach and other 
greens. Usually your blood count should return to normal within 1-2 months. 
If hemoglobin is still low after these dietary measures, I would then 
suggest that you get your self investigated for other causes of anemia as 
mentioned above.
