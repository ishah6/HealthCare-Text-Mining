Lyrica (Pregabalin) has been shown in studies to provide equivalent 
efficacy to gabapentin, however, at much lower doses. Because lower dosages 
can be used to treat neuropathic pain, it is likely that pregabalin will be 
associated with fewer dose-related adverse events. Pregabalin has also 
shown greater potency than gabapentin in the management of pain symptoms.
