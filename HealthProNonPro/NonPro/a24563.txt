I too have bursitis, I have had it for about seven years. Ive been to the doctor, and all she prescribed was pain relievers and she gave me some exercises to do. It didnt help, I just take tylenol and wait it out. Some days are better than others for pain,hang in there,hope you can find some relief,susyq47
