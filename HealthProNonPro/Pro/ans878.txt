Modifying lifestyle with a healthy balanced diet and regular exercise is 
essential in weight control. Due to your calorie intake being less than 
normal, your body may think that you are undergoing starvation and may 
increase the storage of calories. Your weight gain may also be due to 
hypothyroidism. I would suggest that you speak to a dietitian to calculate 
your calorie intake and also get your thyroid levels checked.
