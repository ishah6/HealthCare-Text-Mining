accept you are beatiful and keep in mind that sometimes the best course is getting help. 

Unless you are over wieght to the point that it is affecting your health or could affect your heart, put it lower on your list of things to do. Many people dont relise if you have a few extra lbs extra on you, it is not going to kill you. accept you are bueatiful. 

The depression, show it who is boss, sometimes it might require medication, sometimes conceling, but once again, you have to accept that you are bueatiful and not to be afraid of it. 

the divorce, let it go. it takes two people to make a relationship (unless you want to start talking about theology, but that is a story for another day). it is not completly your fault. we are human, we make mistakes. the worse thing you could do is refuse to forgive a mistake or anothers. best of luck to you, may you go far.
