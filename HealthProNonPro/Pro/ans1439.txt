The pain that you are experiencing during your periods is known as 
dysmenorrhea. There are two types of dysmenorrhea, i) Primary - in which 
there is no evident underlying pelvic organ problem and ii) Secondary - 
which is caused by an underlying pelvic pathology. Upto 50% of all women 
experience dysmenorrhea. If you are frequently experiencing pain during 
periods which are not relieved on anti-inflammatory medication, I would 
suggest following up with a gynecologist. Common cause of secondary 
dysmenorrhea includes endometriosis, ovarian cysts, uterine leiomyoma, 
pelvic inflammatory disease, adhesions and uterine polyps. It is also 
important to rule out an underlying pregnancy. Your doctor may order a 
complete blood count, urinalysis, pelvic ultrasonography, VDRL test and hCG 
to make a diagnosis.
