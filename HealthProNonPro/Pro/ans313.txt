Flu usually takes 10-14 days to resolve and even though you may be 
asymptomatic, flu may be transmitted to susceptible individuals like 
children and elderly. The transmission is through the infected droplets 
during coughing and sneezing and also through direct contact when shaking 
hands. The best way to avoid transmitting flu is to ensure proper hand 
hygiene and covering up when you cough or sneeze.
