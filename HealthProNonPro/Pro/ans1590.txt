There may be many causes of feeling tired and dizzy. Since you have 
mentioned that your blood tests have come back normal, I would maybe look 
in the lines of chronic fatigue syndrome, general anxiety disorder and 
depression. If your symptoms have lasted for a period of more than 6 
months, I would suggest that you consult your doctor in this regard. 
Modification of lifestyle with proper diet, exercise and relaxation 
techniques like yoga and listening to music may help with your symptoms.
