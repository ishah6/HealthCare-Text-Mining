Pregnancy symptoms include extreme fatigue, breast tenderness, nausea, with or without vomiting, constipation, gas, and/or bloating, abdominal cramps, frequent urination, food cravings or aversion, mood swing, and increased vaginal discharge.  If you feel you may be pregnant, your best bet would be to wait 2 weeks after a missed period, and see your doctor for a blood pregnancy test as these are more accurate.
