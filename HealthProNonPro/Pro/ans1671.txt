Uretheritis in your boyfriend could be caused by sexual infections. It is 
possible that you may have contacted an infection if he has tested 
positive. I would suggest that you get yourself tested if you develop signs 
of an infection. During this time, I would advise you to use condoms during 
sexual intercourse to prevent transmission of the infection.
