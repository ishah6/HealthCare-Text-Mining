If you drink alcohol during implantation or anytime during pregnancy, your 
baby is at increased risk of developing Fetal Alcohol Syndrome. Your baby 
may have a range of disabilities ranging from physical, mental to social 
and mental disorders. Children with fetal alcohol syndrome may be small and 
may have learning or behavior problems.It is not known how much alcohol it takes to harm a developing baby. When 
you consume alcohol in pregnancy, it crosses the placenta and reaches your 
baby. Binge drinking is especially bad for the developing baby. If you are 
planning to get pregnant or are already pregnant, I would advise you to 
stop drinking alcohol.
