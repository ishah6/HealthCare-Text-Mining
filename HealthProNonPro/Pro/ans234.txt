Discharge and burning sensation on urination are symptoms of urethritis 
caused due to inflammation of the urethra due to infection. I would suggest 
that you see your doctor for a swab and urinalysis to identify the 
organism. Antibiotics may be required in the presence of infection. Which 
drugs are prescribed and for how long depend on your health condition and 
the type of bacterium found in your urine. Usually, symptoms clear up 
within a few days of treatment. But you may need to continue antibiotics 
for a week or more. You can also try drinking lots of cranberry juice. It 
has an effect of detaching the bacteria from the urethra. I hope this 
helps, take care.
