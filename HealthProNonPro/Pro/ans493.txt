I do understand your concern. For those who do develop long-term hepatitis 
B (known as chronic hepatitis B), medicines are available. While these 
medicines will not cure hepatitis B, they may lower virus levels in the 
body to an undetectable level. Sad to say, Hep B carriers will carry the 
viral antigen for the lifetime; no medication can make you completely 
negative. Most people chronically infected with hepatitis B can expect to 
live long, healthy lives. Once you are diagnosed with chronic hepatitis B, 
the virus may stay in your blood and liver for a lifetime. It is important 
to know that you can pass the virus along to others, even if you don’t feel 
sick. This is why it’s so important that you make sure that all close 
household contacts and sex partners are tested and vaccinated against 
hepatitis B. I wish you well, take care.
