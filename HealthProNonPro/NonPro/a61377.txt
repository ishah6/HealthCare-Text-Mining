I took 4 teeth out. It didnt hurt with the anaesthetic, but it feels uncomfortable with 4 gaps for months. Braces hurt a little when the doctor tightens it once every 6 weeks or so. It hurts during the tightening and hurts about 1 day after that. But I think the pain is definitely bearable. For me, the pain was well worth for the effects achieved.
