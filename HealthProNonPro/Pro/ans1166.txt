Thank you for your question. It is possible that the pain you are 
experiencing is due to a condition known as sciatica. This is caused when 
the sciatic nerve is impinged resulting in severe pain in the buttocks, 
hips, and down the legs. Sciatica usually occurs from prolonged sitting, or 
lower back injuries such as herniated intervertebral discs. We recommend 
that, since your symptoms have been going on for months, follow up with 
your doctor as soon as possible to be assessed for sciatica. You may need 
to take some bed rest and physiotherapy in order to treat this condition 
along with oral analgesic medication.
