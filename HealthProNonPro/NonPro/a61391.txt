What you were told is completely true. But its completely worth it. I am in braces right this very moment, and when I got mine on, I didnt have to have any teeth removed. However, both my sisters did when they got theirs on, so I assume its very commonplace. When you get your braces on, Im not going to lie- The pain is going to drive you insane. You wont be able to eat solids, or really chew for at least a week. Even when you can no longer feel a constant throbbing, it will hurt to bite into things for about a week after that. When you get a new wire and such, your teeth will hurt again. However, the pain will not be as bad as when you first get them on, and should go away sooner.

Braces sound like hell, and to be honest, they kind of are. But they are so worth it, because in the end, you have a beautiful smile you can be proud of- And teeth are something people notice a lot more as you get older. In the long run, youll be happier you dealt with the braces.
