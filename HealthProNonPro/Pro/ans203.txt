Constant flashing in the corner of the eyes warrants medical attention. It 
is important for you to consult your ophthalmologist to rule out 
vision-threatening conditions such as retinal detachment and vitreous 
detachment. Sometimes occular migraines may also cause flashing around the 
corner of the eyes. Retinal detachments requires immediate evaluation and 
treatment. If left untreated, there is a chance of permanent vision loss.
