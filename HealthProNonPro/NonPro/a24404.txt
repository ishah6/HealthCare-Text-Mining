I took a stress management class at work (it was madatory) and one of the most important things the instructor said to do was deep breathing. If you breath and your chest moves up and down, youre not breathing correctly. Your stomach should be going in and out. Breath from your diaphragm (in your nose and out your mouth, too). She also said to meditate. Find somewhere where theres no distractions (very quiet, where you wont be interrupted). Put on some soothing music and picture yourself on a beach. Picture everything about the beach; the sand, the sounds of the ocean. Concentrate on these things, all the while breathing very deeply. 

She also said dont worry about things that you have no control over. Dont let people get under your skin. Exercise. Be around people that make you feel good. Dont take yourself too seriously. 

Hopefully this helped
