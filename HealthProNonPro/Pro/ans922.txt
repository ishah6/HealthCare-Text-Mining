Nasonex is a corticosteroid nasal spray is used to treat seasonal or 
perennial allergic rhinitis in adults and children. It is also used to 
treat acute sinusitis. Even though nasonex is used in the treatment of 
allergic symptoms, your doctor would have prescribed it because nasonex 
also helps to reduce swelling and inflammation in the nasal passages. This 
will relieve associated symptoms such as stuffy nose, runny nose, itching, 
and sneezing.
