Endometriosis is the presence of endometrial tissues in sites other than 
the endometrial lining of the uterus. The most common sites are the 
ovaries, broad and uterosacral ligaments and pelvic peritoneum.Endometriosis typically presents as dymenorrhea (pain during periods) that 
may be accompanied with dyspareunia (pain during sex), spotting and chronic 
pelvic pain.It may also be associated with infertility. Family history for the disease 
is common with a 7 fold increase in endometriosis in first degree 
relatives. I would advise you to consult your doctor for a diagnosis of 
endometiosis and treatment options.The treatment for infertility will include assisted reproductive 
technologies including ovulation induction, intrauterine insemination and 
in vitro fertilization.
