Learn to take a 5 minute stretching break.  Some people refer to this as yoga (a form of stretching). Close your office door, turn down the phone, turn off the computer monitor and speakers and begin a five minute stretching routine for the areas of your body that tighten (as your stress builds). Appropriate stretches can be found in almost all fitness books!
