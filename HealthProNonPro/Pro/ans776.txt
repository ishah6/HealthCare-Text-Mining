It is unlikely that five tables of 650mg of paracetamol would lead to 
acetaminophen poisoning and liver toxicity. The usually recommended dose of 
paracetamol is in between 3-4gm per 24 hours. I would suggest that you 
monitor your symptoms and go to the ER, if you have signs of nausea, 
vomiting, abdominal pain, confusion or generally not feeling well. If you 
are still concerned, call your doctor or the poison control center. A blood 
level of acetaminophen will aid in determining if a toxic dose was taken.
