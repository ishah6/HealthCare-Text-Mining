I do understand your concern. Since the first line management of anal 
fissure (stool softeners, dietary adjustments, analgesics) are not 
effective in relieving your pain, you may benefit with a second-line 
management. These includes topical application of 0.2% nitroglycerine and 
injection of botulinum toxin into the internal anal sphincter to decrease 
the muscle tone of the sphincter, allowing the anal fissure to heal and 
resolution of symptoms. If medical therapy fails to resolve the fissure, 
surgery is indicated. Lateral internal sphincterotomy is the procedure of 
choice. You can also try biofeedback, which is a relaxation training 
technique in which patients are taught to relax the anal muscles.
