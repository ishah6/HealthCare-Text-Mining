Headache, sore throat and swollen gums may be seen in 
pharyngitis/tonsillitis, streptococcal throat infection, infectious 
mononucleosis and viral flu. Usually over the counter medications like 
advil, warm saline gargles and rest is all that is required. If the 
symptoms get worse, you may need to see a doctor for a throat swab, chest 
x-ray and antibiotics.
