Thank you for your question.I would be very hesitant to have laser resurfacing of your lower eyelids. 
In my opinion, there is always a risk of hypo/hyperpigmentation in patients 
with your skin tone. Furthermore, there is a risk of developing an 
ectropion (turned out lower eyelid) with laser therapy to the lower eyelid. 
If the wrinkles of the lower eyelid bother you, a lower blepharoplasty 
(eyelid surgery) may be right for you. The procedure involves making an 
incision just below the lashes to remove the excess fat, and tighten the 
skin to remove the redundancy and smooth the wrinkles. You will go home the 
same day and experience a week of bruising and 2 weeks of swelling. After 
about 2 weeks you can go out in public without sunglasses but will continue 
to heal for about another 2 weeks. Lower blepharoplasty is a procedure that should only be done by board 
certified plastic surgeons who are trained in aesthetic facial surgery. 
Please check the credentials of the surgeon you choose to perform your 
operation.
