After reviewing your symptoms, my most probable diagnosis of your condition 
would be allergic conjunctivitis. Diagnosis of allergic conjunctivitis 
generally is made by taking a thorough history and by careful clinical 
observation. Due to the fact that your symptoms improved with change in 
environment suggest of an allergic cause to the conjunctivitis.I would suggest that you consult your opthalmologist for further 
evaluation. Superficial conjunctival scrapings may help to establish the 
diagnosis by revealing eosinophils.Allergic conjunctivitis can be treated with a variety of drugs, including 
topical antihistamines, mast cell stabilizers, nonsteroidal 
anti-inflammatory drugs, and corticosteroids.
