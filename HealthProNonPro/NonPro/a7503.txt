Also known as Gestational Diabetes, this type of diabetes occurs in 2-7% of women.  Typically happens in the later months of pregnancy. To avoid this, the woman is advised to eat moderately through pregnancy, so as not to carry too much excess weight (beyond the growing baby).

Most women with getational diabetes lose it upon the babys birth, though the condition may recur in subsequent pregnancies.

It is IMPORTANT to controll this type of diabetes (with your doctors guidance), otherwise this condition MAY impact the babys long-term health.
