Thank you for your question.During and after pregnancy, breast size and shape can change significantly. 
Many women will experience a large increase in breast size during pregnancy 
and breast feeding, which reverts once nursing ceases. My recommendation 
would be to wait at least 6 months following the completion of breast 
feeding to allow the breasts to return to the size and shape they were 
pre-pregnancy. Often, patients may require both an augmentation (implant) 
and a lift (mastopexy) to elevate the breast tissue and the nipple position.Your plastic surgeon can discuss your options with you in consultation.
