Though your symptoms of chest pain are suggestive of reflux disease, I 
would advise attending your family doctor for a detailed history of the 
pain and a clinical examination. Your chest pain could be arising from the 
heart, lungs, upper gastrointestinal system or chest wall. Depending on 
your presentation and symptoms your doctor may advice for an 
electrocardiogram and cardiac enzymes to rule out a myocardial infarction.
