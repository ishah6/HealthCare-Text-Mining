Achilles tendonitis is an inflammation of the heel tendon, usually 
resulting from overuse associated with a change in playing surface, 
footwear, extreme stretching or intensity of an activity. Sometimes called 
the heel cord, it is the largest tendon in the human body. When the calf 
muscles contract, the Achilles tendon is tightened, pulling the heel. This 
allows you to point your foot and stand on tiptoe. Certain illnesses (such 
as arthritis and diabetes) and medications (such as corticosteroids and 
some antibiotics) can also increase the risk of rupture. Injury can happen 
in these situations: You make a forceful push-off with your foot while your 
knee is straightened by the powerful thigh muscles. You suddenly trip or 
stumble, and your foot is thrust in front to break a fall, forcefully 
overstretching the tendon or as in your case a forceful stretching of the 
calf muscles. Treatment must reflect a balance between protection and early 
motion: Protection is necessary to allow time for healing and to prevent re 
injury. Moving your foot and ankle is needed to prevent stiffness and loss 
of muscle tone. I advise you a consultation with an orthopedic surgeon to 
determine the treatment and follow-up that is right for you.
