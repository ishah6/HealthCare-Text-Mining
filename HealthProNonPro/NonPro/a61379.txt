My 14 year old daughter just got them. She kept bugging me to get them for her. Its been a week and she keeps bugging me about how much it hurts. I laugh because I went through that and before she got them, I had warned her of all the symptoms. The gum soreness, not wanting to eat, and the moodiness because of it. But you get used to it. Maybe even loose some weight. But the smile and self-esteem is all worth it! If you are a girl you put up with a "period", same thing. Remember pain killers!
