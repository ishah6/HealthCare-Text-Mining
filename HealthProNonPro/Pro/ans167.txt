Breast tenderness may be caused by infection (mastitis), trauma or any 
growth or tumor. It is essential to do a breast self examination and rule 
out any lumps, swellings or abnormal skin changes. Inability to move your 
breast freely, any dimpling or puckering of the overlying skin, discharge, 
redness, pain in the breast and a lump or pain in the armpits are the signs 
of breast cancer and justifies a visit to the doctor.
