Several factors can cause a person to develop persistent dandruff. One of 
the main culprits is a fungus called Pityrosporum ovale. For unknown 
reasons, an overgrowth of Pityrosporum ovale can occur in some people. This 
leads to increased irritation and skin cell shedding on the scalp. Certain 
skin conditions are also known to cause persistent dandruff. These include 
eczema, an inflammatory skin disorder, and psoriasis, the buildup of dry, 
red patches of skin. Medicated shampoos (shampoos that contain specific 
anti-infective and antifungal ingredients to treat conditions affecting the 
skin and scalp) are effective in treating persistent dandruff. Medicated 
shampoos containing Zinc pyrithione, Ketoconazole and Selenium sulfide may 
be used. Along with treatment, making a few small lifestyle changes like 
shampooing hair regularly can help keep fungus populations under control.
