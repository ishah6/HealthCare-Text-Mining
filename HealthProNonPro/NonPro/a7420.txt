Truthfully the only permanent way is to eat less and make it a habit.  If you eat more healthy foods you will be less hungry while taking in fewer calories.

It just take discipline and a desire to do it. 

The Atkins diet does actually work, but it is only designed to be done for short periods (2 weeks) and it requires discipline too. 

Good luck.
