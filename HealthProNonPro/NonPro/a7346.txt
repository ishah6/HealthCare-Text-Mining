This depends on the histology of the mass; whether it is poorly differentiated or not, the staging is perhaps the single most important factor, by the time the tumour is this large, and if indeed it is infiltrating ductal carcinoma NOS, then Id be particularly concerned about metastasis to the lungs and liver, be it lymphangitic spread to the lungs, or hematogenic spread to the contralateral breast.  

In summary, its a difficult question to answer without knowing specific details about the tumour in question. Good day to you.
