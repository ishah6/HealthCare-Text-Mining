Hair gets its color due to a pigment called melanin which is produced by 
the body. As people continue to get older, the number of pigment cells 
around to produce melanin will actually be reduced. Eventually, these cells 
will be so depleted, the hair will look completely gray. Researchers have 
shown that gender plays a role in graying. The average male starts to gray 
around age 30, while women typically began to notice lighter strands around 
age 35. In some families, many members develop white hair in their 20s. 
Sometimes, the arrival of gray hair can be a sign of an underlying health 
problem. Vitamin B12 deficiency is associated with decreased melanin 
production thus leading to greying of the hair. There is no definite cure 
or reversal of greying of hair. I hope that answers your question, take 
care.
