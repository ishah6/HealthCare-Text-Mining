I would suggest that you discard the fabric softener and wash any all 
clothes in which the softener was used. In the mean time I advice you to 
take any anti-allergic medication like cetrizine or allegra which will help 
decrease the allergy symptoms. You will need to consult an allergist if 
your symptoms worsen. I wish you well, take care.
