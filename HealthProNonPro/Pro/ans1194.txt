Thank you for your question. Microgynon 30 is an oral contraceptive 
containing ethinylestradiol and levonorgestrel. This medication can cause 
precipitate transient hormonal fluctuations within the body which can 
result in excessive sweating. We recommend that you report this side effect 
to your doctor and have an examination performed to determine if you need 
to have this contraceptive medication changed to one that will be more 
tolerable and reduce your excessive sweating. Since you were on another 
oral contraceptive that did not cause you to sweat as much, it may be wise 
to change your medication to avoid this side effect.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com with your medical question.
