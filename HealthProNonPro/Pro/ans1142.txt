Thank you for your question. Given the fact that you engaged in heavy 
lifting 2 weeks after your surgery, it is possible that that you may have 
reaggravated your umbilical hernia, either by rupturing the sutures 
partially or completely. In general, it is not recommended to do any heavy 
lifting for about 4-6 weeks after your surgery. The swelling could be due 
to the hernia or bleeding and the accumulation of blood underneath the 
incision. We recommend that you call the surgeon who performed your 
operation as soon as possible to schedule an examination of this area. If 
you reaggravated the hernia, or ruptured any of the suture, it will need to 
be surgically corrected. AskTheDoctor.com wishes you a speedy recovery.
