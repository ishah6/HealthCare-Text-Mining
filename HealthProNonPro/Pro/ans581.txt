I would not advise you to use the remaining antibiotic ear-drops. Every 
ear-drop solution has a lifetime after opening the bottle and once left in 
the open, the efficacy of the medication diminishes. The symptoms that you 
have mentioned - ringing and pressure in the ear, headaches suggest of an 
accumulation of fluid in the middle ear. This usually occurs after a sore 
throat and is viral in origin. You may have to get your ears inspected by 
an otolaryngologist to see for evidence of otitis media and treat according.
