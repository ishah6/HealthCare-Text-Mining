A differential that may be causing your symptoms is migraine headaches. 
Migraines are due to changes in the brain and surrounding blood vessels. 
Migraine headaches typically last from 4-72 hours and vary in frequency 
from daily to less than 1 per year. Migraine affects about 15% of the 
population. The most common triggers are that of glare ie extreme 
brightness, lack of sleep, strobe lights,stress, various foods like 
chocolate etc all of which can lead to a migraine. I suggest you keep a 
symptom diary. An accurate diary should indicate the days you had a 
headache and the severity of the headache. It should also include very 
accurate details on your diet, sleep patters, stress patterns and weather 
patterns that day. There are medications that may help to reduce the 
frequency and severity of the attacks. I suggest that you get an evaluation 
by a neurologist in order to determine the best treatment option regarding: 
medications (pain-relieving and preventive), lifestyle changes that can 
help ease the pain (muscle relaxation, meditation, yoga, get enough sleep, 
avoid wine, chocolate and cheeses)
