Degenerative disc disease produces changes in the vertebrae that along 
with the bulging disc are causing a nerve compression which is the cause of 
the pain. The treatment options depend on the age, severity of the pain, 
neurologic symptoms present and if you have some other associated health 
issue. The first approach is conservative as a Physical Therapy program 
aimed to control pain and inflammation along with anti inflammatory 
medication, if there is no improvement and with time the pain is worse and 
intractable you should get a reevaluation by an orthopedic surgeon or spine 
surgeon to decide if Surgery might be consider as a treatment option for 
you.
