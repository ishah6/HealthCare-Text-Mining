Black colored stools and presence of blood in stools could be the result of 
a gastrointestinal bleed. I would suggest that you take your grandma to the 
ER or her family doctor for further investigations. A colonoscopy may be 
required to determine the site and cause of bleed. If there is a lot of 
blood lost, she may even require blood transfusion.
