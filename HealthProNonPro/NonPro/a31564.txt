1) Diet.  More H2O, more olive oil, more vitamin C..D..E..Calcium...and Omegas.

2)  Try olive oil on skin.  Try pure vitimun E on skin...try oatmeal...try that 24 hour lotion stuff.

3)  Move to a humid climate... if its just that bad, your geographical location can ruin your skin...it may be worth the effort to move to a better location.
