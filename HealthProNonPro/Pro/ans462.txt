I do understand your concern regarding the transmission of HIV. If the skin 
is intact, there would be no risk of HIV transmission even with exposure of 
fluid/blood which has HIV. However there may be small risk ( less than 1 in 
1000) through contact with non-intact skin (healing scabs) or mucous 
membranes.Though there is still understandably an area of considerable concern, since 
you have mentioned that the person whit whom you've had the contact is HIV 
negative after 9 months, there is no risk of infection in your case. 
However you may want to get a HIV test for reassurance. As per your other concern, it is not possible for the HIV virus to remain 
localised in a scab and even if the scab is infected there is less than 1 
in 1000 risk of transmission if someone comes in contact with it. I hope 
the information helps.
