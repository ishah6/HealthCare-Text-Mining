Possibly you are having an allergic reaction, but in the view of your 
multiple eye problems previously, I suggest a reevaluation by your eye 
doctor to test the bilateral patency of the ducts recently placed in your 
eyes. Maybe the right one might be partially occluded and producing the 
swelling. You should also have a consultation with an Allergy specialist as 
well.
