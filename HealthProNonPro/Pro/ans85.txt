Almost everyone is afraid of going to a dentist and I do understand that 
you would rather not have your milk tooth pulled out. However, in certain 
cases it is necessary to remove the milk tooth to ensure a normal 
development of the permanent tooth. Sometimes, a tooth that is not taken 
out may develop an infection known as periodontitis which would cause pain 
and swelling around the affected tooth. I hope this helps, take care.
