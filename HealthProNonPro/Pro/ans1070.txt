Some patients do experience abdominal pain post cholecystectomy. This could 
be caused by Postcholecystectomy Syndrome or a stone remaining in the 
gallbladder (as in the case of your mother). In my opinion, the endoscopic 
method or Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) is the 
treatment modality of choice. ERCP is both a diagnostic and a therapeutic 
procedure and make the exploration of the bile duct and stone removal 
possible without surgery.
