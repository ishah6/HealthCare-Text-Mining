It is difficult for me to comment whether you have melanoma or not. 
Melanoma is a cancer that most often starts in the skin. Melanomas can also 
develop in other parts of the body such as the eyes, mouth and the fingers 
but are rare. The risk of developing melanoma increases with age. Other 
risk factors include fair skin, exposure to sunny climates or high 
altitudes, spending a lot of time outdoor in the sunlight, using tanning 
devices, relatives with a history of melanoma and due to a weakened immune 
system. The only way to accurately diagnose melanoma is with a biopsy.
