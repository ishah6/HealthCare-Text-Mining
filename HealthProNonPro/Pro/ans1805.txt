Your delayed periods could be the result of pregnancy or due to the effects 
of the birth control pill. It sometimes takes 3-4 months for periods to 
return to normal after stopping the pills. You may need to do a urine 
pregnancy test due to that fact that you are having unprotected sex. The 
best time to do this test is 2-3 weeks after the unprotected sex. Hope I 
could clarify your doubts.
