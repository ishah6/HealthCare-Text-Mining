The pain and numbness in your hands, most likely may be due to a residual 
damage produced by the nerve compression that was affecting the nerve roots 
(neuritis) before the operation, or maybe because you still have some 
bulging of the content of one disk and also due to the surgery that might 
have created adherences in the region causing some degree of nerve 
compression. The treatment strategy would be as follows: try to keep a 
proper posture, avoiding repetitive cervical stress (example weight 
lifting), adhering to a healthy lifestyle and proper nutrition, physical 
activity as tolerated, losing excess of weight and during the pain crisis a 
physical therapy program should be followed and aimed to reduce pain and 
inflammation. If there is a poor response to these measures the orthopedic 
surgeon reevaluation may be considered.
