The pain that you are experiencing during menstruation is called 
dysmenorrhea. It is most probably caused by excessive levels of 
prostaglandins and hormones that make your uterus contract during 
menstruation. The pain is experienced when there is release of an egg from 
the ovary and progressively increases as there is shedding of the 
endometrial lining in the uterus.Primary dysmenorrhea is usually treated by medication such as an analgesic 
medication. Many women find relief with nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen, and acetylsalicylic acid 
(Aspirin). Oral contraceptives also may also help reduce the severity of 
the symptoms. Though most of the time the cause of dysmenorrhea is not 
found, I would advise you to see your doctor to rule out endometriosis, 
adenomyosis, ovarian cyst, uterine polyps and adhesion that may cause 
similar pain.
