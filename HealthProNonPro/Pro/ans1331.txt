The concomitant use of viagra (sildenafil) and beta-blockers may lead to 
decrease in blood pressure. Sildenafil has to be used with caution in 
patients with cardiac diseases. I would suggest that your boyfriend consult 
his doctor for further evaluation. He may be able to take viagra at the 
lowest possible dose provided his blood pressure is stable. I hope the 
information helps.
