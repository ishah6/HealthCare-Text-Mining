The lymph node like mass that you are feeling near the right testicle is 
most probably the epididymis. The epididymis is a coiled segment of the 
spermatic ducts that serves to store, mature and transport spermatozoa 
between the testis and the vas deferens. What you are feeling is normal 
anatomy and there is no need for concern unless there is tenderness.
