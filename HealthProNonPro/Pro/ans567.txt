I understand your concern about your mother's health. Anorexia nervosa is a 
mental illness characterised by preoccupation with body-weight and shape, 
leading to a failure to maintain normal body weight, fear of becoming fat 
and a distorted perception that one is overweight leading to a refusal in 
maintaining a normal body-weight.Anorexia is diagnosed by a doctor/psychiatrist after a thorough history and 
physical examination. There are certain diagnostic criterias that are 
needed for the diagnosis of anorexia.i) Refusal to maintain bodyweight greater than minimally normal (<85%) 
weight for age and height.ii) Intense fear of weight gain or becoming fat, even though underweight.iii) Disturbance in the way body-weight, size, shape or shape is 
experienced, denial of seriousness of current low body-weight.Taking steps towards recovery from anorexia is a major undertaking. It 
requires co-operation and support from family, friends, doctor and the 
community. The treatment goal is to restore your mother's weight to 
approximately 90% of predicted ideal weight, treat any physical 
complications, address dysfunctional beliefs, instill self esteem and 
prevent relapse.I would suggest that you or any other family memeber do not confront your 
mother about her eating habits, which will make it worse. The therapy 
should be carried out by a team of professionals experienced in treating 
eating disorders, which includes a psychiatrist and a nutritionist.
