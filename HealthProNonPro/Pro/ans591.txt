I would suggest you to discuss with your doctor for further evaluation and 
tests such as a complete blood count, urinalysis and a chest x-ray to 
determine the cause of infection. Though viral infection may present with 
similar symptoms, it is important to rule out other underlying causes such 
as a urinary tract infection or a chest infection. Treatment will depend on 
the causes. I wish you well, take care.
