Accutane has many side-effects and you being concerned is reasonable. The 
use of accutane may cause colitis, esophagitis, nausea, pancreatitis and 
inflammatory bowel disease. I would advise you to discontinue the drug and 
see your doctor if you experience abdominal pain, loose stools or rectal 
bleeding. Your doctor may require a complete blood count, sedimentation 
rate, glucose, CPK and LFT to determine the cause of pain.
