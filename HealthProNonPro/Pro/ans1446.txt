The Plexiform neurofibromas are the hallmark lesion of Neurofibromatosis 
type 1 (NF1). These occur in 30% of NF1 patients, are usually congenital, 
and affect long portions of the nerve involved; infiltration of the nerve 
itself and the surrounding tissue may occur, giving rise to extensive 
disfiguration. The finding that you described in the MRI is classic of 
these kind of tumors, which are mostly located in the cervical spine 
causing problems to the surrounding structures as the occipital bone.
