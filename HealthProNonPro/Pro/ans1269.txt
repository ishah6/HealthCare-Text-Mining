Thank you for your question. This type of sexual encounter would be 
considered low risk for the transmission of STIs. The only area where you 
may could have been exposed to an STI was from being touched bare handed by 
the masseuse. However, this was very briefly and would therefore be 
considered a very low risk for contracting STIs such as HIV or herpes. We 
do not believe you should be concerned by this.We hope AskTheDoctor.com has addressed your medical question.
