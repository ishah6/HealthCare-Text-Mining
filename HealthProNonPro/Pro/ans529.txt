I do understand your concern. There are a number of reasons that your 
periods could be delayed. Stress, increased exercise, weight changes, 
anemia, decreased food intake may all cause a delayed period. I would 
advise that you withhold your contraceptive pill until you get your 
periods. If you do not get your periods into the next cycle, I would 
suggest seeing a doctor for further evaluation. In the meantime use other 
methods of contraception like contraceptives. I hope this helps, take care.
