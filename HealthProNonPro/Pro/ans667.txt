Isolated ulna fractures can most often be treated with a cast or fracture 
brace. Usually a period of immobilization will allow the bone to heal 
adequately. I am assuming that your fracture was isolated, uncomplicated, 
non-displaced and that’s why the treatment was by a cast for 10 weeks. 
According to the x-rays done in you follow up is up to your doctor decide 
when you will be able to begin to do again weight training depending on how 
well the bone has healed. Usually after the cast removal you should follow 
a Rehab protocol that includes Physical and Occupational therapy with the 
goal of restoring full range of motion and strength while maintaining 
independence in as much of your activities of daily living as is possible. 
In addition to undergoing supervised rehabilitation, you should be 
instructed in a home exercise program to be practiced daily and continued 
independently after the completion of rehabilitation. Your doctor 
ultimately will give you the clearance to begin training with weights.You 
also are at risk, by age, gender and complexion, of Osteoporosis, make sure 
that your bone calcium is adequeate.
