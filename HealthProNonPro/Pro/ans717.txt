It is difficult to make an accurate prediction as to who is the father of 
the baby. Ovulation takes place, on average, about two weeks before your 
period, though it can vary from 10-16 days before the onset of menstruation 
depending on the length of your luteal phase. During an “average” 28 day 
cycle, ovulation is usually expected to take place between cycle days 
13-15. Many women, however, do not have average cycles and even those who 
usually do may see irregularities from time to time. Also sperm deposited 
prior to ovulation can survive in the female reproductive tract for a few 
days, so a DNA test may be the only way to accurately determine the father 
of the baby.
