Headaches can step from multiple causes. It is most probable that your 
constipation is causing you to have a headache. Headaches and constipation 
can also be present in people with fibromyalgia.I would suggest that you first take measures to control the constipation. 
Increased in dietary fibres, laxatives like lactulose and senokot may help 
relieve your symptoms. If these measures don't help, your doctor help may 
help to diagnose an underlying problem.
