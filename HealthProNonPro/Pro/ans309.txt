First of all, keep your weight under control, meaning that if you are 
overweight try to lose some extra pounds that may be putting extra stress 
in your joints. Then, try to follow, at least 3 times a week a consistent 
exercise routine, because maybe you are not having enough physical activity 
which is causing problems to your joints. If after you try all of the 
above, you are still having problems I strongly recommend you to have a 
complete evaluation by a Rheumatologist, including lab and imaging tests to 
determine the cause of your symptoms and accordingly proceed to choose the 
best treatment option.
