What you may be experiencing is post-concussion syndrome. It is a complex 
disorder characterised by symptoms such as headaches and dizziness. It may 
last for weeks and sometimes months after the injury that caused the 
concussion. There is no specific treatment for post-concussion syndrome and 
your doctor may treat you according to the presenting symptoms. 
Amytriptilne and reglan may be used in severe cases to dizziness.
