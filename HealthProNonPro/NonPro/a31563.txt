Drinking lots of liquids is a good idea, but for dry skin caused by detergent allergies, dry heated winter air, soap residues from not rinsing well after showering or batheing, detergent residues in towels and sheets caused by turning off a second rinse in your washer, etc. It may also be necessary to apply a good topical emollient. Such as, Vasoline intensive care hydrotherapy, Cornhuskers lotion, Udderly Smooth -designed for cow udders, but available at Walmart for people-, glycerin, or baby oil (scented mineral oil). It may be a combination of things. Change one at a time until you figure out a cause and then work from there.
