Abscence of thought is pure peace of mind. There is no other feeling quite like it. 
 I believe with a great deal of practice that you can control your thought pattern, so that no thought enters it for a short period. It is not easy, especially with the possibility of distraction. But it can be done and it centers you, you will feel more energy, having clearer thought process and many other benefits. This has been said to be a religion of sorts but that is not how I ever used it, I would use to just relax for myself not to give money to someone for a word to repeat to get to that state. Find one word , preferably single syllable and use that as your mantra. It usually has a meaning special only to you and how can anyone tell you that.
You can slow down if not totally end the thought process for a short time with practice. It does not work for all but for some its a blessing.
