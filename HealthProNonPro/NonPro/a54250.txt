Depression can develop into an eating disorder, 
said Carolyn Weiss, an advanced practice registered nurse at the Suburban Center for Eating Disorders and Adolescent Obesity in Bethesda, which is affiliated with Suburban Hospital. Many people with eating disorders experience depression, anxiety, substance abuse and childhood sexual abuse, according to the Womenâ€™s Health Office with the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

A person can go three weeks without any food and survive without any long term ill effects. 

The duration of survival without food is greatly influenced by factors such as body weight, genetic variation, other health considerations and, most importantly, the presence or absence of dehydration. 
Medical practitioners encounter cases of near-total starvation in patients suffering from, among other conditions, anorexia nervosa and end-stage malignancies, as well as in those following so-called starvation diets. In anorexia, death from organ failure or myocardial infarction is fairly common (up to 20 percent of cases end this way) and tends to happen when body weight has fallen to between 60 and 80 pounds (although it can occur at any time). This weight typically corresponds to a body mass index (BMI) approximately half of normal, or about 12 to 12.5. (Normal BMI is 18.5-24.9, and most fashion models have a BMI of around 17.)
