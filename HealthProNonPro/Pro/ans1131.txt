Thank you for your question. Based on your description, it is possible that 
you could be developing a perianal abscess. Perianal abscesses occur when 
an infection near the anus occurs resulting in the collection of pus near 
the anus. This can result in a painful swelling which increases in size and 
can eventually painfully rupture. Your condition seems to be in the early 
stages of this and we recommend that you see your doctor as soon as 
possible to have this examined and start a course of antibiotics to treat 
it. If you choose to wait this abscess may be unresponsive to antibiotic 
treatment alone and may need to be surgically drained. This is done by 
applying a small incision in the area of the abscess and draining the 
excess fluid, relieving the pressure and pain. Please see your doctor.AskTheDoctor.com wishes you a speedy recovery.
