Your symptoms are most probably due to Acute sinusitis (acute 
rhinosinusitis). This is caused by infection of the sinuses that cause the 
cavities around the nasal passages to become inflamed and swollen. There is 
excessive mucus buildup which may make it difficult to breathe. Smoking 
further aggravates the problem. Treatment is by saline nasal spray, 
decongestants (sudafed, actifed), nasal sprays containing phenylephrine or 
oxymetazoline and over-the-counter pain relievers such as aspirin, 
acetaminophen (Tylenol, others) or ibuprofen (Advil, Motrin, others). 
Antibiotics usually aren't needed to treat acute sinusitis, but may be 
required in the presence of bacterial infection. It is best to avoid 
smoking during this time.
