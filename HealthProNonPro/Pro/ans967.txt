Pain located on the left side of the abdomen could be indicative of peptic 
ulcer disease, gastritis, kidney stones, abdominal muscle strain. My advise 
would be to take pain killers like advil or motrin to see if this help to 
relieve the pain. If your symptoms worsen, you may need to book an urgent 
appointment with your doctor or go to the ER.
