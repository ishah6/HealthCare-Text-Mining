Dizziness is a very unspecific complaint and there could be numerous 
conditions that have dizziness as a symptom. Dizziness is a complaint and 
may involve problems with the brain, inner ear, heart, blood vessels, lungs 
and certain neurological problems. I would definitely not take light of the 
symptoms and would advise that you see your doctor or a neurologist to rule 
out problems such as anemia, orthostatic hypotension, hyperventilation 
syndrome and hypothyroidism. Treating the dizziness that accompanies these 
medical problems should always begin by identifying the underlying disease 
and treating it directly.
