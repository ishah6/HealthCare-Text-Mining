Ferritin is an intracellular protein that binds to iron and stores it 
inside the body. This iron is then released when it is needed by the body. 
The ferritin test is an indirect measurement of the amount of iron in the 
body. A decreased amount of ferritin will make you prone to anemia. The 
common symptoms of anemia are fatigue, tiredness, dizziness and headaches. 
As the anemia progresses you may develop breathlessness, chest pain, oral 
sores, body aches and sometimes craving for eating dirt, chalk or clay 
known as pica. A low ferritin may also be due to an underlying disease such 
as liver disease, autoimmune disease, chronic infections and in certain 
cancers. I would advise you to consult with your physician to determine the 
cause of the decreased ferritin levels. A diet containing green leafy 
vegetables, spinach, cereals, meat, fish and poultry will help in 
increasing the ferritin levels in the body.
