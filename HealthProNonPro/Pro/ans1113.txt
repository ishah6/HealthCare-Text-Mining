Thank you for you question. Given the fact that you have had multiple 
non-invasive treatment options without any long term relief you may need to 
consult a podiatric surgeon or orthopedic surgeon to determine if you 
require surgery to treat your condition. The common surgery that is 
performed in the treatment of plantar fasciitis is a plantar fascia release 
procedure. In this procedure, the surgeon will make an incision at the 
bottom of the foot, locate the plantar fascia and make an incision within 
it sever it from its attachment to the heal. After this is completed, you 
will need to undergo weeks of healing and physiotherapy to adequately 
recover, after which this will likely relieve your pain. Plantar fasciitis 
can indeed put excessive tension on your achilles tendon resulting in pain 
as well. After this procedure is performed, and you are adequately 
rehabilitated, you can expect to be pain free. Please consult a surgeon for 
further evaluation.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
