There is, for the moment, no cure for this condition.  It is hereditary, so watch your parents.  Likely, the amount they shake is the amount you will shake at their age.  

Beta-blockers (propranolol) can treat the symptoms of this condition but have their own side-effects (headaches, sexual dysfunction, low blood pressure, fainting, depression, etc).  Id only recommend them if its necessary for you not to have a tremor for some job-related reason. 

Otherwise, I agree with the previous poster...learn to live with it as much as you can
