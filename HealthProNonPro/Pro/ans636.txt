In the normal pleural space, there is a steady state in which there is a 
roughly equal rate of the formation (entry) and absorption (exit) of 
pleural fluid. When this balance is disrupted due to either an increase in 
the production or decreased absorption, this leads to pleural effusions.There are various conditions that can lead to accumulation of fluid in the 
pleural spaces. Infections/pneumonia, acute lung injury, tuberculosis, 
pulmonary edema, malignancy and endocrine abnormalities such as 
hypothyroidism may all cause fluid accumulation in the lungs. You will need 
to see your health care provider for physical examination, chest x-ray, 
complete blood count and pleural fluid analysis to make an accurate 
diagnosis of the cause. treatment will depend on the cause. I hope the 
information helps.
