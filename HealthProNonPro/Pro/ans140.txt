Bleeding in pregnancy may be dangerous and needs to be evaluated by your 
doctor. Bleeding affects 20%-30% of all pregnancies. Bleeding in the first 
trimester (first 3 months of pregnancy) could be due to several different 
factors. It is important to rule out a threatened miscarriage. Other causes 
are complete miscarriage, incomplete miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, molar 
pregnancy and post-coital bleed. Bleeding may also be unrelated to 
pregnancy as in infections and trauma to the vaginal wall.Bleeding during pregnancy needs urgent attention and I would advise you to 
consult your health care professional.
