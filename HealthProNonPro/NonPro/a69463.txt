Im just wondering how a guy accidently cheats....I mean is there just some woman bending over, the guy trips and ooops! pop goes the weasel?
You are sitting here talking about her considering your needs...women only care about themselves, how can you compare infidelity to crying at a freaking movie?
I am really hopeing this is like some kind of tongue in cheek thing. 
If you are screwing up royally, thats not singling out, even more so when you accidently screw someone else 6 times. 
Its not an accident, so grow up, admit that you are more interested in going around screwing who ever you feel like. 
She did the right thing. Maybe someday you will grow up and knock it off and realize the value of being with one person.
