Foul smelling vaginal discharge could be the result of bacterial vaginosis. 
The causes of bacterial vaginosis are sexual activity, vaginal douching, 
improper hygiene and recurrent antibiotics. Treatment includes oral or 
vaginal metronidazole and also vaginal clindamycin cream. Oral 
metronidazole can cause some minor but unpleasant side effects, but is 
believed to be the most effective treatment. I would advice that you see a 
doctor who can speak your language for further evaluation. Take care.
