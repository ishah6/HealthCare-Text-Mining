Your symptoms may be caused by Raynaud's phenomenon. This is a rare 
disorder that affects the arteries marked by brief episodes narrowing of 
the blood vessels causing your fingers and toes to turn blue. The cause of 
Raynaud's is not known though it may be linked to diseases and conditions 
that damage the nerves that control the arteries in the hands and feet eg. 
lupus and scleroderma. Treatment include avoiding cold temperatures, 
emotional stress, workplace or recreational factors, and contact with 
certain chemicals or medicines and smoking. Medicines used to treat 
Raynaud's include calcium channel blockers, alpha blockers, prescription 
skin creams, and ACE inhibitors.
