Fordyce spots or Fordyce granules are relatively common in men. They are 
harmless small yellow-white spots found on the genitalia and are caused by 
hyperplasia of the sebaceous glands. Most men are worried by these spots as 
they think they could be caused by a sexually transmitted disease or some 
form of cancer. I would suggest that you talk to your doctor or a dermatologist. There are 
a number of effective treatment options available, such as calcipotriol and 
steroid creams.
