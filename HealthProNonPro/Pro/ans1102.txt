Taking too much alcohol in a short period of time and its withdrawal could 
be the cause of your headaches. I would suggest that you continue drinking 
plenty of fluids. Anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen, naproxen or pain 
relievers like acetaminophen can help treat a hangover headache. Keep in 
mind that binge drinking is more harmful to brain cells than any other 
pattern of drinking..
