Migraines can be one-sided or involve both sides, usually has triggers and 
worsened by physical activity; phonophobia (sensitive to sound) and 
photophobia (sensitive to light) are also common. Nausea (feels like 
vomiting) can be your body’s response to the pain. Some migraine attacks 
last for 3 days. For mild attacks of migraine, Ibuprofen, Aspirin, and/or 
Naproxen may be helpful. If these won’t help, you may need prescription 
pain relievers for migraine (Tylenol #3, Ergot derivatives). I strongly recommend that you to get a thoroughly evaluation by an 
internal medicine doctor or neurologist to rule out any underlying 
pathology. For preventing migraine attacks, prescription drugs are also 
helpful: amitriptylline, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, etc. I 
hope this helps. Take care always.
