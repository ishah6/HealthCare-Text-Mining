I did that last year during after school. Its usually because your work stresses you out and you want to actally have some fun while pretending to work. Curbing the habit is easy.
If youre still in school, grab a hot new video game or computer game and make yourself finish the task at hand before youre allowed to play it. 
If you have a job, try working away from the computer. If your job actually involves working on a computer, takes some time off for a minute, do some yoga or another excersise that aids in relaxing your mind and body. After that, close any other internet windows on your computer and get to work.
