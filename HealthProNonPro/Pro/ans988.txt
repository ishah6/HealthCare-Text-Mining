Pleurisy occurs when the membrane that lines the inside of your chest 
cavity and surrounds each of your lungs becomes inflamed. Pleurisy occurs 
as a complication of a wide variety of underlying conditions such as 
pneumonia, viral infections, tuberculosis or trauma. It is unlikely that 
increased milk intake will help in the treatment of pleurisy. Treatment 
will include over the counter pain killers (NSAIDS) and antibiotics if you 
have an underlying pneumonia.
