Thank you for your question. It is possible that the combination of the LSD 
and MDMA is causing his urinary retention. We are not certain as to when he 
will be able to urinate. This is a medical emergency and your friend should 
go to the emergency room to have a catheter placed in order to empty his 
bladder. This will prevent excess urine from damaging his kidneys.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
