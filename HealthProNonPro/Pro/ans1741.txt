White patches on the skin could be caused by a number of conditions. The 
skin discoloration could be a manifestation of eczema, a superficial yeast 
infection or other skin diseases such as psoriasis and vitiligo.I would advise a consultation with a dermatologist for further evaluation 
of the white skin patches. Treatment will depend on the cause. In the 
meantime try to avoid skin exposure to direct sunlight and apply sunscreen 
with a high SPF rating.
