I would not advise increasing the dose or iron with prior assessment of 
your hemoglobin status. It may require several weeks or even months to 
treat anemia due to iron deficiency. Initially dosage of ferrous sulphate 
is 300 mg per day which can be increased upto 4 times a day depending on 
the severity of the anemia.
