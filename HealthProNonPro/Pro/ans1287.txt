Thank you for your question. XFERT MF is an alternative medicinal 
supplement that is not tested or approved by the Food and Drug 
Administration. It is manufactured and distributed within India alone and 
cannot be found in generic form in other regions of the world that we know 
of. Unfortunately, it seems as though that there is no equal alternative to 
this medication available in your region of residence.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
