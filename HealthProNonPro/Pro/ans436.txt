I do understand your concern for a yeast infection. You can treat most 
yeast infections with an over-the-counter antifungal cream such as 
clotrimazole which goes by the brand names Lotrimin and Canestan. Other 
common OTC antifungal creams include the brand names Monistat 1 
(tioconazole), Tinactin (tolnaftate) and Lamisil.It is advised that you first apply a thin layer to the affected area. If 
you experience a persistent burning, swelling or itching sensation, you may 
need to contact your doctor.
