Thank you for your question. This is not a recommended form of treating 
dehydration. Inserting a tampon soaked with any foreign liquid can result 
in infection and irritation of the vagina. To treat dehydration it is best 
to drink adequate fluids and electrolyte fortified drinks. In severe cases 
of dehydration it is best to go to the emergency department to have 
intravenous fluids administered.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
