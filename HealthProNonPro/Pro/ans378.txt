Home pregnancy test are fairly accurate in detecting pregnancy if done 
during the right time. Urine tests for pregnancy are most sensitive 2-3 
weeks after conception. Before this, the pregnancy hormone levels may not 
be high to be detected in the tests. The test is accurate if you take it a 
week after you miss your periods (you may have to wait a couple of days to 
repeat the test). The test should be done in the morning with the first 
urine sample as it contains the most hormone concentration. I hope this 
helps, take care.
