Possibly during the effort of lifting you injured your knee and your back: 
muscle strain. Usually this occurs when the back muscles have been 
stretched and/or overloaded beyond normal limits, commonly known as a 
muscle pull. If you have a lumbar sprain, your ligaments have been pulled 
apart resulting in spasms in the lower part of your back. Regardless of 
which type of strain you have, the course of treatment for both is the 
same. You will experience inflammation, spasms, lack of mobility all these 
insure limited movement. To go to a chiropractor is one of the treatment 
options for an uncomplicated muscle strain in the back, meaning when there 
is no nerve damage or compression, muscle rupture documented by MRI. They 
may teach you useful exercises to stretch the muscles in the spine, that 
you can repeat at home as a routine and after, apply ice to the sore area 
for no more than 20 minutes each time; you could also alternate warm moist 
compresses with ice packs. If after follow all of the above you still 
experience the pain associated to some other symptoms, like numbness in the 
legs then I would recommend to visit an Orthopedic doctor to rule out some 
other more serious causes of the back pain.
