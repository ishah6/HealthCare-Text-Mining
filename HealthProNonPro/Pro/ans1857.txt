Your symptoms of not being able to control your arm could be due to radial 
neuropathy or sometimes known as "saturday night palsy" or "honeymoon 
palsy". This usually occurs when a person falls asleep, compressing the arm 
and subsequent radial or median nerve, causing the symptoms. The symptoms 
are usually not being able to extend the wrist upwards, numbness at the 
back of the hand and unable to move or straighten the arm.Usually this condition is not permanent and recover occurs after 5-10 mins. 
However if you frequently experience these symptoms, I would advise you to 
consult your doctor for further evaluation.
