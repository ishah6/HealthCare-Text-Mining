I do understand your concern regarding your mother's health. You have 
mentioned that your mother had a couple of pimples on her scalp. It is a 
possibility the the enlarged lymph node is due to the scalp infection. I 
would suggest that your mother see her doctor for antibiotics if necessary. 
If the lymph-nodes do not subside with antibiotics or your mother has 
additional symptoms like weight loss, fever and night sweats, I would then 
suggest a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.
