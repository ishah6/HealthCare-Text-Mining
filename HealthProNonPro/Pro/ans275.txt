Esophageal perforations, tears and hematomas usually result from traumatic 
injury to the oesophagus following following instrumentation, such as after 
gastric lavage or upper GI endoscopy, or excessive vomiting. It is unlikely 
that swallowing french fries would cause an esophageal perforation. 
Symptoms of esophageal rupture will include excruciating pain behind the 
chest and upper abdominal pain associated with difficulty in breathing, 
increased heart rate and shock. Your esophageal laceration should heals 
spontaneously within several days and not additional treatment is required.
