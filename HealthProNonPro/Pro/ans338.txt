Glucosulin is a dietary supplement that claims to help in weight-loss. The 
ingredients are mulberry extract, konjac root, xanthum gum, chromium 
picolinate and sodium alginate. There is no supportive evidence that shows 
glucosulin to help in weight-loss. I would be cautious in using the drug. 
Following a healthy lifestyle, with adequate exercise and a healthy diet 
may be more beneficial in your case. Hope the information helps, take care.
