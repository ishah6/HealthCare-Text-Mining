It is unlikely that your drinking wine would have caused the nose to change 
color. Bluish discoloration of the peripheries may be a sign of cyanosis 
due to decreased supply of oxygen to the part. I would definitely advice 
that you visit your doctor for a physical and for tests like complete blood 
count, hemoglobin levels and chest x-ray.
