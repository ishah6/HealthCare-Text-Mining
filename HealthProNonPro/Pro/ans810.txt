It usually takes 2 to 3 months for the body to heal and the uterus to 
decrease in size. It is difficult for me to answer your question. It may be 
that the endometrial lining of the uterus has yet to recover after the 
miscarriage. I would advice you to see you OBGYN specialist for a thorough 
check up and investigations.
