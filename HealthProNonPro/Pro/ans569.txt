I understand your concern for your symptoms of excessive sweating. Women 
often experience a variety of symptoms that include hot flashes or flushes, 
insomnia, weight gain and bloating, mood changes, irregular menses, 
mastodynia, depression, and headache. Women who are in menopause may be 
prone for osteoporosis and coronary artery disease. You may need to take 
hormonal replacement therapy if your symptoms are severe.
