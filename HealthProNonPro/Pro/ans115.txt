As a parent it is difficult to see your children go through pain. I do 
understand that you daughter is going through a lot in her life. Your 
daughter's bursitis may only be a part of the problem she is facing. 
According to what you have mentioned, there is a strong indication of an 
underlying depressive disorder. Financial strain, experiencing major life 
changes, chronic pain and social isolation, presence of all these indicated 
screening for depression.Bursitis is self-limiting and is usually treated conservatively with 
application of heat, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and 
corticosteroid injections in the bursa. Significant number of patients are 
able to keep their symptoms under control with lifestyle changes and 
physical therapy and more than 2/3 of patients on injections will find 
relief. The presence of major depression will further aggravate the 
symptoms of pain. Your daughter may have to consult her physician for 
screening depression and treatment modalities like psychotherapy, 
antidepressant medication or a combination of both. I do feel that her 
symptoms of pain will improve once treatment is started.
