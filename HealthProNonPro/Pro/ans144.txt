Blood in semen or hematospermia causes anxiety due to fears of malignancy 
and sexually transmitted infections. What causes blood in semen is not 
known. It may be due to inflammation of the urethra, prostate and seminal 
vesicles due to infection. Prostate cancer may be a rare cause of 
hematospermia.Investigation includes semen analysis and culture, urine culture and 
analysis, prostate specific antigen and ultrasound to the testes, seminal 
vesicles and scrotum. Most cases of hematospermia require not additional 
treatment. Chronic or recurrent hematospermia may require a genital and 
rectal examination by your doctor and cystoscopy to rule out urethral and 
prostatic pathology.
