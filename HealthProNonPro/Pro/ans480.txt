I do understand your concern, though anorexia may cause amenorrhea, I would 
suggest that you consult your gynecologist regarding this problem. The 
cause for primary amenorrhea could be due to anatomical and congenital 
reasons, hormonal imbalance and ovaries not functioning properly. A 
complete examination and blood-work will determine the cause of the 
amenorrhea. I hope I could answer your query.
