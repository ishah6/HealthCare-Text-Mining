When I want to destress, I put on some music, fill a hot bath, add some epsom salts (wonderful for adding magnesium which is a required mineral that stops spasms and helps you relax) and add some lavendar scent.  Then I lay back and breathe and dream of all the things I want to be doing and enjoying. 

Forget the work, the worries, the problems.  See what YOU really want and just imagine doing it.  (The next step is DOING it.)

One other thing that I found keeps me destressed from day to day is to look in the mirror when I wake up and laugh.  At first, it seems really corny.  But laughing is a great destressor and laughing at yourself is even better.  When you get to the point where you can belly laugh when you look at yourself (make faces if that helps) that youve got it knocked.
