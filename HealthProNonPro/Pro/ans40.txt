Abnormal uterine bleeding can be caused by numerous problems. The first 
step in the management id to determine whether the bleeding is ovulatory or 
anovulatory. Ovulatory bleeding is typically cyclic, but heavy or prolonged 
whereas anovulatory uterine bleeding refers to unpredictable endometrial 
bleeding of variable flow and duration and is the most common cause of 
abnormal uterine bleeding. Stress, significant weight loss, and exercise 
can disturb the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarian axis and are common causes 
of bleeding. I would advise that you watch your symptoms and take NSAIDs 
like motrin and advil to decrease the pain and bleeding. If your periods 
are recurrently heavy, visit your doctor for a physical examination and 
further evaluation.
