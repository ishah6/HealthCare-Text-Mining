Since you've mentioned that there is no history of trauma, the cause of 
your scrotal pain could be due to orchitis of epididymitis. I would suggest 
to consult your doctor for examination and investigations like urinalysis 
and testicular ultrasound to determine the cause of pain. Treatment will 
depend on the cause. Both orchitis and epididymitis are treated with 
antibiotics.
