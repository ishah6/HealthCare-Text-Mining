Body odor is usually due to the breakdown of sweat into acids by the 
bacteria present in the skin. People who are obese, those who regularly eat 
spicy foods, as well as individuals with certain medical conditions, such 
as diabetes, are more susceptible to having body odor. People who sweat too 
much - those with hyperhidrosis - may also be susceptible to body odor. If 
over-the-counter antiperspirants don't help control your sweating, your 
doctor may prescribe aluminum chloride (Drysol, Xerac Ac). For best 
results, apply the antiperspirant at night to the areas most prone to 
sweating. Also certain lifestyle modification like bathing often, wearing 
natural fabrics such as cotton and changing diet (eliminating caffeinated 
drinks from your diet as well as foods with strong odors, such as garlic 
and onions) will help.
