A spinal disk is like a jelly donut, with a softer center encased within a 
tougher exterior. Sometimes called a slipped disk or a ruptured disk, a 
herniated disk occurs when some of the softer "jelly" pushes out through a 
crack in the tougher exterior. A bulging disc has intact the fibrous outer 
layer that contains the softer center, but is bulging and compressing the 
exiting of the spinal nerve root adjacent. The herniated disc has the 
fibrous outer layer broken and the filling is extruded mostly toward the 
near spinal nerve root in the vicinity, generating compression and damage. 
Bulging disks are more common. Herniated disks are more likely to cause 
pain. But many people have bulging disks or herniated disks that cause no 
pain whatsoever.
