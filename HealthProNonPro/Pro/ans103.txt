Anemia can certainly cause rhythm disturbances of the heart. The symptoms 
that you've mentioned, dizziness, irregular pounding heartbeats and 
headaches may be the result of anemia but it is important to rule out other 
serious diseases of the heart like heart block and myocardial infarction. 
You will need to see your doctor for an electrocardiogram or a 24 hour 
Holter to monitor any irregularities of the heart rhythm. A cardiologist 
may need to see you if any abnormality is detected.
