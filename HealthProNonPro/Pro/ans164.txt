Breast pain is a common symptom for which many women go to their doctor. 
The etiology of breast pain is not clearly understood. In my opinion, your 
pain could be the result of trauma or a hormonal imbalance. The symptoms of 
breast pain are frequently seen during pre-menopause. The appropriate 
management of breast pain would be to see you doctor for a breast 
examination and get a mammogram, but since you've already had a mammogram 
done, no further tests are warranted. If the pain is severe and is 
continuing, analgesics, vitamin E supplementation and avoiding coffee 
helps. More severe cases of pain may benefit with antigonadotropin 
medication (Danazol).
