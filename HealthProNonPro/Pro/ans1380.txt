The lump may be an enlarged bartholin gland, that is located at the 
entrance to a woman's vagina, one on each side. They are small and cannot 
be seen or felt when they are normal. They may enlarge due to infections or 
blockage of the glands, and may need treatment if it does not reduce or go 
away within a few days on its own. Best home treatment is to have sitz bath 
3 to 4 times a day for at least 15 minutes each. If pain, redness, fever or 
other symptoms start to develop, it may be a sign of infection or abscess 
formation and in that case you will need antibiotics.
