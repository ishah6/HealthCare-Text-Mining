From what youve said, it seems to me that the only times you two are having intercourse is when one or both is drunk. You need to ask yourself why. Is he this way when hes not drinking? Plus this guy sounds like a mean drunk...hes hurting you and doesnt seem to care...this could be foreshadowing future problems with him later, perhaps even abuse. Why would you want to be with him? You are 22, and Ill bet youre hot looking, and there are plenty of guys out there who know how to treat a lady. I wish I could find someone whos as eager as you are to please the man shes with.

The drinking and the mean temper and the erectile dysfunction are all clear signals that this guy needs help. IF you want to stay with  him, tell him to get help. Otherwise (and this is my advice to you), leave him before you get hurt, both emotionally and physically. This guys a ticking bomb.

Hope this helped. Good Luck
