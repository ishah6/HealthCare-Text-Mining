It bothers you, and you dont have to put up with it. Just go ahead and tell them. Be polite in asking, but explain its mostly because it bothers you. Dont tell them its because you want them to stop because its bad for them. They dont care obviously. Tell them its bad for you.

They most likely will care, and avoid smoking around you. However - there is a risk factor of them sending you to your room whenever they want to light up...
