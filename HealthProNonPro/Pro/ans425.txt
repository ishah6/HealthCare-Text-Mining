I do understand you concern, and although your symptoms may suggest of an 
underlying pathology, we may need to investigate further to get to the 
cause. Your blood-work suggests of lymphocytosis. This can be caused by 
various conditions like infections, Crohn's and ulcerative colitis, 
vasculitis, hyperthyroidism, connective tissue disorders and leukemia. Your 
symptoms of easy bruising may also be indicative of vasculitis. I would 
suggest that you consult your doctor in this regard and follow up with 
regular blood-work every 6 months.
