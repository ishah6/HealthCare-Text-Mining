While your headaches and feeling faint may be related to your anxiety, 
passing foul smelling gas is a different entity itself. You need to speak 
with your family doctor in person about the symptoms of anxiety and panic 
attack and also address the concerns about abdominal discomfort. Supportive 
psychotherapy, desensitization techniques and medications like 
benzodiazepines are usually helpful to decrease the symptoms of anxiety. 
You may need to take antacids to decrease abdominal discomfort.
