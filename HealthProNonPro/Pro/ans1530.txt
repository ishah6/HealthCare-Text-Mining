There are many causes for irregular periods. Stress, excessive weight gain 
or loss, excessive exercise, illness, hormonal problems and problems with 
pelvic organs, all may lead to irregular periods. I would suggest you to 
consult with your doctor for a complete medical check-up and investigations 
what may include complete blood work-up, hormonal and thyroid tests and 
ultrasound.
