The pain is most probably due to the irritation of the stent on the ureter. 
The pain should subside within a week. If the frequency of pain increases 
or becomes unbearable, I would suggest that you consult your doctor. It is 
important at this moment to drink plenty of water to help flush out any 
infection or hematuria which can cause irritation of the bladder.
