I am totally agree with your doctor, sometimes during the nerve block in 
the shoulder incidentally branches of the nerves that supply sensitivity to 
those areas might be touched, the repair process in the nerves occurs 
approximately 1mm/day, usually the recovery is 100%. Taking vitamin B 
complex helps to the nerve recovery. Be patient and possibly in 2-3 months 
would be advisable to perform a EMG to assess the nerve function.
