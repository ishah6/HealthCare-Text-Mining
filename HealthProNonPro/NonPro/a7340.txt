Actually at 35 ( and even younger) you can fall into what is called peri menopause, it is like pre menopause, I am 42 and I on occasion get hot flashes, but trust me it is not just getting hot! it comes from deep within and works it way out until you are red in the face and sweating. Thankfully I am still in the peri stage and it is quite possible your co-worker is too.
