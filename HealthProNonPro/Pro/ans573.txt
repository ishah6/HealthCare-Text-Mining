I would advise you to get your hemoglobin checked. Bleeding after pregnancy 
may make you prone to iron deficiency anemia. Treatment will depend on the 
level of hemoglobin, with oral iron tablets and dietary measures for mild 
cases of anemia and injectables and blood transfusion required for more 
severe cases.
