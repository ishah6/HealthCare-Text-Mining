Excess facial and body hair in women is called Hirsutism. This may be 
caused due to high levels of male sex hormones called androgens. Most cases 
of hirsutism are not severe and have no underlying cause. However, 
sometimes there is a more serious underlying condition, such asCushing's 
syndrome, polycystic ovarian syndrome and congenital adrenal hyperplasia.You may need to see your doctor for a medical history, examination and 
certain tests like blood-work for androgen levels, CT scan, MRI, pelvic 
ultrasound, to find cysts or tumors on the ovaries or adrenal glands. The 
treatment of hirsutism depend on the underlying cause and the severity of 
the symptoms.Overweight women with hirsutism may want to lose weight so 
their bodies will produce less testosterone. If no underlying cause is 
found, a combination of self-care strategies and hair-removal techniques 
may be used.
