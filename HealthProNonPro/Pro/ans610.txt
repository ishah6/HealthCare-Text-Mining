If you have fever, sore throat and swollen lymph nodes on the neck, there 
is a high chance that you may be having strep throat and your doctor may 
not need to take a throat swab and may treat you emperically. Though I 
would presume, he would get a throat swab done if he found your symptoms to 
be indicative of strep throat. A throat swab is routinely performed and 
only causes a slight momentary discomfort.
