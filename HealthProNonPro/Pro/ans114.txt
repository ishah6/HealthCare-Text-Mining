Appropriated technique is very important for the push ups, because this 
exercise works many muscles at the same time, and if you use a wrong 
technique can easily cause injury in the muscles of the neck or shoulder. 
The pain that you described in your neck muscles following a set of pushups 
may indicate a strain in the neck muscles, or in more serious cases, a 
sprain. During both the downward and upward phases of the pushup, keep your 
head aligned with your spine. If you crank up your neck during these 
phases, or if you allow your neck to hang, you may cause strain or injury 
to the neck muscles. Keep your jaw relaxed during both phases. As an added 
precaution, perform the pushup with your elbows squeezed against your ribs. 
This modification transfers some of the force away from the shoulder joint 
to the triceps, which may in turn alleviate some of the spasms in your neck.
