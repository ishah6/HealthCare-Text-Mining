It is possible that sleeping with your contact lenses would have resulted 
in corneal injury or infection of the eye. Your symptoms of pain, increased 
lacrimation and photophobia do indicate an infective pathology. I would 
suggest that you consult an ophthalmologist for an examination. You may be 
required to take antibiotics in presence of infection.
