Discomfort and lower abdominal pain in the presence of an IUD requires 
examination by your doctor. During the examination, your doctor would see 
the presence or absence and length of the IUD string. Any discharge will be 
evaluated and tested with pH testing and wet prep. Your doctor may also 
test you for chlamydia and gonococcal infection depending on your sexual 
history and the presence of symptoms of cervicitis. If the uterus is 
tender, treatment with antibiotics may be required in presence of infection 
(pelvic inflammatory disease). If the pain ad discomfort clears on 
antibiotics, there is no need for the IUD to be removed, but if the 
tenderness persists, IUD removal may be appropriate.
