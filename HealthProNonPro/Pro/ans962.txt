Pain in the stomach after meals, especially with spices could indicate 
acute gastritis or a peptic ulcer disease. Gastritis can be caused by 
infection (especially h. pylori), infection, acute stress, medications like 
pain killers, alcohol and allergy to certain foods.I would advise you to continue with the medications prescribed by your 
doctor for gastritis, if you have no relief after 14 days, I would advise 
you to consult with your doctor. Treatment for H.Pylori infection or an 
endoscopy may be the best next step in the management of gastritis.You may also decrease your symptoms by taking a diet which consists more of 
fibres, reduce spicy foods, advoid coffee and tea.
