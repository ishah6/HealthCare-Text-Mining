I would say to just to practice as much as possible even if you get frustrated,thats okay.All you have to do is like I said,practice as much as possible and then you will get better at whatever you need more self-esteem on!Then you might go overboard!Try not to, and try not to brag once youve gained your self-esteem!Right on!
