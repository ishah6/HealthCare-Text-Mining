Thank you for your question. It is likely that what you have observed was a 
ruptured comedone (pimple). The white substance you have observed is likely 
to have been a purulent exudate (pus) which is produced by bacteria in the 
sebaceous gland. This should likely heal without complication. We recommend 
that you do not pick at it to prevent bleeding and scarring. Should this 
lesion continue to produce any discharge, and it becomes painful, we 
recommend that you have it examined by your doctor to determine if there 
are any infections developing.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
