Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) refers to infection of the female upper 
genital tract leading to one or more of the following: endometritis, 
salpingitis, oophoritis, pelvic peritonitis, and perihepatitis. Prompt 
diagnosis and treatment are important to reduce the risk of both short- and 
long-term complications. Pelvic inflammatory disease can cause permanent 
injury to the fallopian tube leading to changes in the ciliary action, 
fibrosis and occlusion of the tubes, potentially leading to tubal 
infertility. Tubal damage also causes an increased risk of ectopic 
pregnancy. I would suggest that you see a gynecologist for appropriate 
antibiotics in the presence of infection. I would also advise the use of 
condoms. Condoms appear to be protective against long-term complications of 
PID. Women with PID who consistently use condoms are less likely to develop 
recurrent PID or infertility.
