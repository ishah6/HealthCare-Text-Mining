Get plenty of rest...avoid dairy whenever possible, take tons of vitamins, dont take a lot of cold medicine just for symptons you have and read the ingredients..a lot of times cvs brand or wal mart brand is same as name brand minus name and works better (did a bio test on it once). dont stress take a hot shower to steam out any phlem and mucus, and as a last result see a doctor..when you do eat make sure its nutritious not junk.
