The white tongue could be an indication of oral thrush/candidiasis. This is 
suggestive of a weakened immunity and is seen in individual with poor 
health, older age groups, weakened immunity, long term antibiotic use and 
on steroid medication.The symptoms of abdominal pain is suggestive of peptic ulcer disease. In 
90% cases, this is caused due to infection by H.Pylori. Other causes could 
be infection by yeast, NSAIDS, smoking and stress.I would advise you to consult with your doctor. Microscopical examination 
from scraping of the tongue could give evidence to oral thrush for which an 
anti-fungal is needed. Your doctor may also advise for an upper GI 
endoscopy to visualize the gastric mucosa and duodenum and take a biopsy if 
needed. Treatment of H.Pylori is by antibiotics and H2-blockers.
