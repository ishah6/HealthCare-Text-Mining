I do understand that we all feel tired from time to time. But it becomes a 
concern if the symptoms last for a long time and there is no cause 
discovered. The reasons for tiredness could be physical, psychological or 
an underlying illness.Both obesity and being underweight cause tiredness and fatigue.Psychological causes are depression, insomnia, increased worries and stress.Underlying illness like anemia, chronic infections, diabetes, 
hypothyroidism and cancer can also cause fatigue.The steps that you can take to improve your fatigue are :i) Improve sleep by setting up a routine for sleep. Not drinking coffee/tea 
before going to bed and refrain from watching television, reading books in 
bed.ii) Getting adequate exercise and a proper diet.iii) Relax by listening to music or do yoga/stretching exercises.If these measures don't help, then you may have to consult your doctor. A 
complete blood count, thyroid levels and a chest x-ray may help in the 
diagnosis.
