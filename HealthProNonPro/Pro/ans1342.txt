The dizziness that you are experiencing is due to orthostatic hypotension. 
This may be cause due to hypovolemia (a decreased amount of blood in the 
body) as indicated by your iron deficiency.It’s usually recommended that 
precautions be taken to avoid dizziness after standing. These may include 
taking medication for anemia, increasing fluid intake, and getting up more 
slowly to avoid an extreme drop in blood pressure.
