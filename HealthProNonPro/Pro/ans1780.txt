You may be having symptoms of flu. This is most probably caused by a virus 
but in certain cases there may be an underlying bacterial infection as 
well. Due to the fact that your cough is getting worse, the presence of 
mucous and sore throat, I would advise that you see you doctor for an 
examination. Depending on your symptoms he may take a swab for strep. 
throat and prescribe antibiotics.The best bay to ensure that your child and husband don't catch the 
infection is by covering your mouth when you cough and washing/use hand 
sanitizers regularly, before and after touching objects in the house.
