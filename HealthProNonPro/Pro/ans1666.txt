Unfortunately you may have to see your doctor for appropriate management of 
a urinary tract infection/cystitis. Unnecessary antibiotic use may result 
in antimicrobial resistance in the future. A urinalysis is the diagnostic 
test for UTIs and treatment is warranted when there is symptoms of dysuria, 
presence of more than trace urine leukocytes and presence of nitrates.
