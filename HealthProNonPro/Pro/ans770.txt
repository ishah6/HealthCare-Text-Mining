It is true that the efficacy ( ie the effectiveness ) of the OCP's does 
reduce when taken concomittantly with antibiotics . However the nuva ring 
is applied locally and thus the hormones are released locally and there is 
little or no metabolism it goes through as it does not enter the systemic 
circulation and thus there is little effect on the efficacy when taken with 
antibiotics. However, since no contraceptive measure is 100%, it is still 
adviced to use back up protection during that time period. I hope this 
helps.
