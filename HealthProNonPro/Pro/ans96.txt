An elevated RBC count is known as polycythemia. The red blood cell 
signifies the number of red blood cells in a given volume of blood. The 
normal range is between 4.2 - 5.4 million cells/ul in women and 4.7 - 6.1 
million cells/ul in men.Increase in the RBC count is seen in polcythemia vera, chronic obstructive 
pulmonary disease, congestive cardiac failure and pulmonary hypertension. 
It is also seen people living in high altitudes. Elevated levels of AST and 
ALT may be due to injury/inflammation of the liver by infection or cancer. 
You may need to see your doctor to further diagnose the cause of the 
increased RBC count and AST/ALT levels.
