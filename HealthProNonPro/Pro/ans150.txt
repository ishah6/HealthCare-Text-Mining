Blurring of vision is a common side effect of your antidepressant 
medication, but it usually goes away on its own within a couple of weeks of 
starting an antidepressant. With certain antidepressants, it may cause 
longer symptoms. You may need to talk to your doctor about using special 
eyedrops to relieve dryness. Also your doctor may change your 
antidepressant or lower your dose. An eye exam may rule out blurring caused 
by other underlying eye problems.
