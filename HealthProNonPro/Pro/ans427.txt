I do understand your concern about bleeding after medical termination of 
pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding is common and typically heavier than a period, 
but not usually excessive. Usually bleeding may last anywhere from 8 to 17 
days, but in some may even continue till 60 days.Medical abortion is effective in upto 90-98% of the cases. However, there 
is a small chance that surgical abortion may be needed in-case of failure 
of medical termination of pregnancy. Depending on how far along in the 
pregnancy you were, and how sensitive you are to hormones, you may have 
pregnancy hormones still in your body for up to a year after an abortion. 
It can take from 6-24 months after an interrupted pregnancy before your 
body and hormonal systems return to normal. This is why I would recommend 
that you see your doctor for a follow up.
