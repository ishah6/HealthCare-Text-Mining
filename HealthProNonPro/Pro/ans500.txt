I do understand your concern. It can be quite distressing at times when 
medical management options provide little relief. Usually the goal of 
management in the treatment of anal fissures is to relieve the constipation 
by using stool bulking agents (fybogel) and laxatives (movicol). I would 
advise you to continue with fybogel and supplement it with movicol as 
needed. Sitz bath after bowel movement may also provide symptomatic relief. You may also consult your doctor whether a surgical option (lateral 
internal sphincterotomy) would be a good option in the treatment of your 
chronic anal fissure. Studies have shown the lateral internal 
sphincterotomy is more effective than botox injections in healing chronic 
anal fissures.
