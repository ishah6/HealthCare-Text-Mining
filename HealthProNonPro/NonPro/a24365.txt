Your best bet is to go to your doctor so he can perform a blood pregnancy test as these are a lot more accurate, and the best time to go would be two weeks after a missed period. Late periods can be due to pregnancy, hormonal imbalance, infection, stress, polyp, cyst, just to name a few.  If the blood test comes back negative, then your doctor can do a further examination to see whats going on.
