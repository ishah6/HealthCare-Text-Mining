I do understand your concern about a viable pregnancy but wouldn't be 
worried just yet. The most common cause of absence of fetal pole and yolk 
sac is getting the dates wrong. I would advise you wait and watch and 
hopefully an ultrasound in a couple of days may show positive results. 
Another way to predict a viable pregnancy is by monitoring the rise of the 
beta HCG levels. I hope I could be of some help, I wish you all the best.
