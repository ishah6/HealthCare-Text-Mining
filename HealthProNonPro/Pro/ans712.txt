It is difficult just on the basis of history to make a diagnosis of skin 
cancer. There are certain risk factors that increase the chances of 
development of skin cancer and include fair skin, age, excessive sun 
exposure, history of moles (nevi), precancerous skin lesions, family 
history of skin cancer and a weakened immune system. The diagnosis can be 
confirmed by a skin biopsy. I recommend that you consult your GP, who after 
an initial clinical assessment may refer you to a dermatologist for early 
treatment. Treatment for skin cancer and the precancerous skin lesions 
varies, depending on the size, type, depth and location of the lesions. 
Small skin cancers limited to the surface of the skin may not require 
treatment beyond an initial skin biopsy that removes the entire growth.
