Swallowing is a complex act that involves the mouth, throat area, and 
esophagus (the muscular tube that moves food to the stomach). Many nerves 
and muscles control how these body parts work. Part of the act of 
swallowing is under voluntary control, which means you are aware of 
controlling the action. However, much of swallowing is involuntary. The 
pain may be felt high in the neck or lower down behind the breastbone. It 
is most often a strong feeling of uncomfortable squeezing and burning, and 
may be a symptom of a serious disorder. Possible causes of painful 
swallowing are as follows: infections or abscess in the back of the throat, 
esophagus problems (achalasia, spasms, reflux disease). I strongly 
recommend you to visit your doctor and get a comprehensive evaluation 
including lab and imaging tasts in order to rule out early any kind of 
serious condition.
