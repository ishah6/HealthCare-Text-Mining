In my opinion the drainage from the nose could be the result of drainage 
from an infected sinus. I would suggest your friend to consult an 
otolaryngologist for further evaluation. Viewing the sinuses through a 
fiberoptic scope may help diagnose sinusitis. Treatment will include 
antibiotics and surgery to clean and drain the sinuses if necessary.
