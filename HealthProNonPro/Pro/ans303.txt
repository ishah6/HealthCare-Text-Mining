Fibromyalgia is difficult to diagnose because there are no tests to do so, 
then you have to pay attention to symptoms like: sore spots in the muscles 
(tender points), aches and pains for at least three months, fatigue, 
sleeping problems, anxiety and depression, dizziness, memory problems. I 
recommend you to get a consultation with a Rheumatologist who will ordered 
the appropriate lab and imaging tests in order to rule out other possible 
causes for your symptoms; also a psychologist and a Physical therapist are 
very useful. The treatment options include: medication (like “Cymbalta”) 
may be used, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy which helps you to learn what 
triggers the pain so you can cope with it, also muscle relaxation and 
stress management techniques like meditation. The exercise may help you 
too, because the more active you are the less pain and depression you have, 
to learn an exercise routine you can use a Physical Therapist to teach you. 
So, in summary try to get enough rest, practice a consistent exercise 
routine, keep yourself active and learn techniques that relieve your stress.
