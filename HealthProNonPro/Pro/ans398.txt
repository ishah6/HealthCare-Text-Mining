I can understand your concern. Dry mouth is a common side effect of CPAP 
machines and usually a humidifier helps to relieve the symptoms. You may 
try the following measures to try help minimize the symptoms of dry mouth :i) Make sure that the mask is the right size for you. Everyone has 
different needs and face shapes, so the right style and size mask for 
someone else may not work for you.ii) It is a good idea to keep a glass of water at your bedside to avoid 
having to get up to get a drink.iii) If Biotene oral gel does not help, you may try a new product call 
xylimelts which stimulates saliva formation and acts as a oral lubricant.iv) Chin straps can help keep the mouth closed during sleep and may be a 
simple solution to dry mouth.v) Make a constant effort to keep the position of your tongue to the roof 
of the mouth.vi) Your doctor may prescribe a nasal steroid spray if your dryness doesn't 
respond to heated humidity.Using a CPAP machine can be frustrating at times, but you need to continue 
with it. The treatment is essential to avoid complications of sleep apnea 
like fatigue and heart problems.
