I do understand your concern. Patent foramen ovale (PFO) is a hole between 
the left and right atria (upper chambers) of the heart that fails to close 
naturally soon after a baby is born. PFO is present in everyone as a fetus 
for normal circulation and generally closes off in the first year or two of 
life. However in up to 25% of the population these do not close off. In 
general terms they do not cause any harm. If your child has no other heart 
defects, she will have normal health. If you notice that your child is 
turning blue when crying, feeding or having a bowel movement, contact your 
child's doctor immediately.
