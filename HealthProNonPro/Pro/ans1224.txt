Thank you for your question. The follicular cysts are benign cysts of the 
ovary (non cancerous) which with careful monitoring by your doctor, will 
resolve on their own. The reason you were placed on these oral 
contraceptive medications is because the cyst is effecting your normal 
menstrual cycle. If this cyst continues to affect your menstrual cycle or 
grows in size where it obstructs the supply of blood to the ovary or 
fallopian tubes, , then more invasive surgical methods of treating it may 
be indicated.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com with your medical question.
