I do understand your concern for the lower pain abdomen that you are 
experiencing. It is most likely that the pain is a referred pain from the 
epididymal cyst.Usually no treatment is required for an epididymal cyst. However if the 
pain becomes severe, you may need to consult your doctor for surgical 
excision or sclerotherapy.
