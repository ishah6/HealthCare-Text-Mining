The symptoms of bloating and burping may be caused due to certain foods 
like beans, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, sprouts, onions and garlic. 
Increased sugar intake, chewing gum, smoking, constipation and stress may 
also contribute to factors causing bloating. I would suggest that you 
identify the food that aggravates your problem and reduce its intake. Over 
the counter antacids like tums may provide relief to your symptoms.
