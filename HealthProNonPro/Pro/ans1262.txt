Thank you for your question. This lump in your thigh could be a lymph node 
or a benign tumor composed of fat called a lipoma. If this lump is not 
causing you any discomfort, or is not unsightly, we do not think you should 
be overly concerned by it. However, we would like you to ere on the side of 
caution, and simply have it examined by a doctor in person, to make sure it 
is not serious.
