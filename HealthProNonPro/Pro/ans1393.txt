The most common cause of foul smelling vaginal discharge and irritation is 
due to bacterial vaginosis. In this condition, the normal bacteria in the 
vagina are replaced by lactobacilli and gardenella vaginalis. The diagnosis 
will depend on microscopic examination of the discharge and physical 
examination. You will have to see your gynecologist for antibiotics to 
treat vaginosis. Antibiotics like metronidazole and clindamycin are 
affective in bacterial vaginosis.
