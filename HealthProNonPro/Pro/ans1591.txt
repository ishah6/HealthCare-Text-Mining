There may be many causes of lack of concentration and tiredness. I would 
advise you to consult your doctor and maybe look in the lines of chronic 
fatigue syndrome, general anxiety disorder and depression. Modification of 
lifestyle with proper diet, exercise and relaxation techniques like yoga 
and listening to music may help with your symptoms. Take care.
