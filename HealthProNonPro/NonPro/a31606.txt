ive never tried it. But i read experimention, for example alcohol (listed), is psychologically health. you learn. shieet. our presidents did it. bill did it. bush did it. i dont know about gore but considering his roommate, he probably did it. so you know it cant be that bad.

plus you gotta experience life and everything it has to offer. so ill probably try it one day, but im just afraid my friends will pull out some gay sh.it if i get blazed. i dont want a penis drawn on my face and have it photographed and put on facebook.
