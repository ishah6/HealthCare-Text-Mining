Though GERD and gastritis may cause symptoms of chest pain, the most 
probable cause of chest pain in your case could be due to costochondritis. 
This condition is very common in young adults and adolescents. 
Costochondritis may be caused due to exercise, infection, cough or injury 
at the site of pain. The most common sites of pain are the fourth, fifth, 
and sixth ribs. This pain increases on inspiration and may make it 
difficult ot breathe. The diagnosis of costochondritis is made by physical 
examination. Blood-work and chest-ray may be normal. Treatment consists of 
rest, NSAIDS and muscle relaxants.
