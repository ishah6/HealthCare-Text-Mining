Eye floaters are usually harmless and develops when the viterous fluid in 
the eye condenses, generally no treatment is required. However, they can be 
associated with significant eye disease such as retinal detachment which 
can lead to blindness. If you see a sudden increase in the presence of eye 
floaters, or symptoms of loss of peripheral vision or flashes of light, 
consut your opthalmologist right away. Unfortunately, I would not be able 
to recommend you a doctor. I wish you the best, take care.
