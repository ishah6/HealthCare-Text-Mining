Thank you for your question. The process of defecation is governed by a 
part of the central nervous system known as the Parasympathetic Nervous 
System (PNS). This is probably normal response to the defecation reflex 
that your son is experiencing. Sometimes, parasympathetic activity occurs 
elsewhere within the body during the time of defecation. This would include 
salivation, tearing of the eyes, urination, gastrointestinal disturbances, 
chills and lastly vomiting. Since your son is only experiencing chills at 
the moment, it would not be a serious cause for concern. We would suggest 
that if this continues, to the point where he is unable to control his 
bowel movements or it is causing him a lot of distress, please take him to 
be examined by a pediatrician.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
