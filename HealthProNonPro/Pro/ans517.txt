I do understand your concern. Pregnancy tests can stay positive upto a 
month after D&C and does not necessarily indicate a problem. If your 
pregnancy test is positive after 3-4 months, it could indicate pregnancy. I 
would advise that you consult your doctor for a physical examination and 
blood test for pregnancy.
