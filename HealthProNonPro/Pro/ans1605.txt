This is most probably due to a sebaceous cyst or a lipoma. Sebaceous cysts 
can become inflamed or infected causing an increase in size and tenderness. 
Both these conditions do not require any treatment. If you feel that the 
cyst or lipoma is growing in size, you may ask your doctor to surgically 
remove the lump.
