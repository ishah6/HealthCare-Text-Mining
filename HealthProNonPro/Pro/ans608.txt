If you follow your doctor directions and a good physical therapy program 
aimed to regain range of motion and strengthen the leg muscles, it is not 
likely that you have any sequels. Just keep in mind that you should not 
strain your knees and try to keep your weight under control as well as a 
healthy and consistent exercise routine.
