Your symptoms of runny nose, dizziness and aches & pains are suggestive of 
a viral infection. No treatment is required other than tylenol for the 
aches and pains. The viral flu should subside on its own within 7-10 days, 
if not earlier. However, if your symptoms worsen, or you develop a fever or 
cough, you may need to see your health-care provider for antibiotics.
