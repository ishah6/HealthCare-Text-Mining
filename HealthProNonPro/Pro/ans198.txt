Common causes of vaginal itching include chemical irritants such as 
detergents, fabric softeners, yeast infection and vaginitis. I suggest that 
you should visit your doctor for accurate diagnosis and treatment. Swab 
test may also be done on your visit to identify the infecting organism. You 
may need some antibiotic or an antifungal, depending on the infection. I 
would also suggest that you avoid feminine hygiene sprays and douches, keep 
your genital area clean and dry and wear cotton panties.
