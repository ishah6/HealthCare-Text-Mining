Testicular pain could be due to various contions. They could be due to :Infection or Inflammation: The most common condition related to testicular 
inflammation and infection is epididymitis. This condition can occur at 
any age, may cause severe, sudden pain.Trauma or Injury: Sports injuries or puncture wounds to the scrotum should 
be assessed quickly. Lumps found may or may not be related to the injury 
but need to be examined.Testicular Torsion: This is a medical emergency. It is rare and occurs 
when the testicles "twist" and cut of the blood supply. It causes acute 
severe swelling and needs to "untwisted" within 5 hours. Surgery is 
commonly required.I would recommend taking over the counter pain killers like advil and 
motrin to relieve the pain. I would also advise that you wear loose cotton 
undergarments and avoid any strenous activities.
