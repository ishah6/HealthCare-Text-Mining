Vitiligo is an pigmentary disorder of the skin and mucous membranes, and it 
is characterized by depigmented macules and patches. The cause of vitilogo 
is not know but it has been proposed that there is an autoimmune 
destruction of the melanocytes (the cells that give skin color).Vitilogo is associated with disorders such as thyroiditis, graves disease, 
diabetes, inflammatory bowel disease, addison disease and pernicious 
anemia. Due to the association of vitilogo with autoimmune and inflammatory 
diseases, it is probable to find elevated levels of white blood cell count.
