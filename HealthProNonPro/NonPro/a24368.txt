Hematite (AE) or haematite (BE) is the mineral form of Iron (III) oxide, (Fe2O3), one of several iron oxides. The ore sometimes contains slight amounts of titanium. When shaped into ornaments, it is often called black diamond.

 
Physical Healing
Mineral and crystal healers associate Hematite with blood and use it in their rituals for treating blood-related illnesses such as hemophilia, anemia, heart, kidney and liver diseases, cardio-vascular weakness, menstrual cramps, and nose bleeds. They also recommend it for use in treating the stress of jet lag, birth and surgery, tumors, insomnia, leg cramps, nervous disorders and fevers. Hematite was also a Native American remedy for dental problems, pimples, canker sores and alcohol abuse.

Mental Healing
Crystal healers credit Hematite with the ability to bring about a calm mental state, improve memory, mental focus and concentration, bolster self-confidence, and increase the effectiveness of logical processes of the brain. Considered by followers of the New Age to be an excellent stone for treating mental stress, Hematite has a reputation for helping people bring order to mentally chaotic situations by drawing tension out of the body, neutralizing negativity and releasing anger. They also recognize its power for increasing mental function and believe it can improve memory, mathematical processes, logic, creativity and mental dexterity. Finally, it is an excellent aid in meditation, recognized by healers for calming the mental state, tuning the consciousness and increasing the pathways that lead to inner knowledge.
