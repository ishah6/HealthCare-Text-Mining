find out the exact time you are ovulating...this is the best time for u and your mate to have sex...if you have been trying for a while without success maybe it is just not your time or perhaps u could be under alot of stress....stress is no good when trying to have a  baby... you should also make sure your diet is healthy to keep you immune system good...also talk to your GYN doctor
