If you can afford it, I would suggest finding a reputable gym and hiring a personal trainer.  Be sure to check your trainers background, certifications and education.  Theres a wide variance of skill level and education level of trainers out there.  You need one who is well educated in nutrition and exercise physiology to work up a proper strength/cardio/diet program for you.
