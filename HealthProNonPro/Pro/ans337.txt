Getting easily bruised is common with age. Although most bruises are 
harmless and go away without treatment, easy bruising can sometimes be a 
sign of a more serious problem. Bruises form when small blood vessels 
(capillaries) near the skin's surface are broken by the impact of a blow or 
injury — often on the arms or legs. Some people — especially women — are 
more prone to bruising than are others. As you get older, several factors 
can contribute to easy bruising, including: aging capillaries and thinning 
skin. However in some cases these signs and symptoms can indicate low 
levels of or abnormally functioning platelets. To diagnose the cause of 
your bruising, your doctor might check your blood platelet levels or do 
tests that measure the ability of your blood to clot.
