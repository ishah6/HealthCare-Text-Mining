I try kiddos out on peanut products and honey at 12 mos. Every kid is different. Give them a little bit and watch them for an hour or two. If they start reacting, have the childrens Benadryl at the ready. Most of the 1 year olds that I care for are loving those PB & J sandwiches by the time they turn 13 mos. !! Just be practical and youll be fine... :)
