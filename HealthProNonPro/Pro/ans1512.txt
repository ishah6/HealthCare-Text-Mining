The test for pregnancy is best done two weeks after the sexual act. You 
should do the test in the morning. It is also probable that your delayed 
periods is due to excessive stress. If your pregnancy test is negative, I 
would suggest you to wait and watch and consult your doctor when you have 
not had periods for 2 months or more.
