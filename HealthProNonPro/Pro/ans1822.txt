Your occupation requires constant kneeling and knee flexions in various 
degrees. Knee pain is the most common presentation of patellofemoral 
syndrome. The pain typically is located behind the kneecap and often shows 
during activities that require knee flexion and forceful contraction of the 
quadriceps (e.i. during squats, ascending/descending stairs or pendants). 
Pain may be worsen by sitting with the knee flexed for a long period of 
time, such as while watching a movie, hence leading to the terms "theatre 
sign" and "movie-goer's knee." The causes are diverse: Overuse (repetitive 
use or activity), overloading, and misuse of the patellofemoral joint. The 
suggested strategy for conservative treatment should be as follows: try 
exercises to strenghten Quads previous adequate stretching (weights or 
byke), pain control with ice packs after exercises, anti-inflammatory meds 
(i.e.: “Aleve”, “Advil”), identify and avoid those activities that can 
aggravate the pain. You could use during the acute pain episodes a knee 
sleeve with no pressure over the patella.Also, and very important, is the 
need for extended adherence to the exercise regimen, meaning keep a 
consistent daily routine of walking, or bicycle or gym (weights and 
stretching). Allow time for these conservative measures (i.e.: exercise 
program) to have an effect, usually 4-6 weeks is adequate for some 
resolution of symptoms.
