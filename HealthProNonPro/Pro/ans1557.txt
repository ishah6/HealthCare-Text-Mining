There are several causes of arm-shoulder pain; one of the most common is 
the Rotator Cuff tendinitis and this seems to correspond with the 
description that you made of your pain. The rotator cuff is a group of 
tendons that support the shoulder. These tendons can be injured during 
weight lifting, when playing sports with a lot of throwing, after 
repetitive use over a long time or suffer degenerative changes with the 
aging process. Typically, presents with an activity related dull ache in 
the upper outer arm and shoulder. Activity is commonly more difficult and 
painful above the shoulder level (more than 90 degrees). There is little or 
no discomfort with below-shoulder-level activities (less than 90 degrees) 
such as golf, bowling, gardening, writing, or typing. But, tennis, 
baseball/softball, basketball, swimming, and painting are more problematic 
and painful.Conservative treatment of the Rotator Cuff tendonitis involves: 
physical therapy to control pain and keep range of motion of the shoulder, 
avoidance of painful movements and activities; anti-inflammatory drugs 
(i.e.: “Advil”, “Aleve”). If you show poor or no improvement, then, local 
corticosteroid injection may be considered.
