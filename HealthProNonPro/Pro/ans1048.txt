Several types of stress may cause back, neck pain. Some causes are: poor 
posture causing misalignment of the head, neck and shoulders; wear and tear 
over the years causing arthritis; and age. Such activities can aggravate 
neck pain: sleeping on 2 or more pillows where your head is at an angle; 
reading in bed; poor posture while gaming (i.e. X-Box, Playstation); and 
prolonged stress while working at the computer. Whatever your reason for 
neck pain, a physical therapist can help you recover quickly, teach you 
good habits, teach you exercises to strengthen your neck muscles to prevent 
reoccurrences to reduce ongoing pain or stiffness. What can you do for neck 
pain? First, seek your doctor for a thorough evaluation and obtain a 
diagnosis. Second, stay active. Try to keep up with your normal activities, 
bed rest is not necessary.When your neck hurts, the goal is to keep your 
spine in a neutral position. Avoid bending your head forward or off to the 
side. Rest is necessary for short periods. However, remember you want to 
try to keep active. It is just as important to allow your neck to rest. If 
your neck gets tired, the muscles will stiffen as a result. Avoid resting 
with too many pillows. Try to fill in the gap of the back of the neck and 
the bed with a pillow preferably with a memory foam one or if that is not 
tolerated, a down pillow can be formed under the neck and head. If possible 
change your mattress for a memory foam one.
