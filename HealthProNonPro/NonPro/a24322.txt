Professionalism is a combination of things:  what knowledge you have about your job, how you treat people while on the job and your overall attitude about the job.  

As an example, I manage a movie theatre, which means I deal with a lot of people at one time.  Not only do I need a great deal of knowledge about the film showing and coming attractions, I also need to know about every food product we serve right down to the calorie content.  I also need to know about sanitation procedures and what is the proper product to use in order to maintain every piece of equipment in the business.  Over and above all of that, though, I need to know how to treat the customers as well as my employees.  Being professional is not only about having knowledge, though.  You can have all the knowledge possible about a topic and still misuse it.  Wisdom is also needed in order to make it an effective tool.  There are some things done at some times and other things at other times.  The wisdom is in when to use these tools.  I must have a good method...Ive been in management in some form or another for almost 20 years.
