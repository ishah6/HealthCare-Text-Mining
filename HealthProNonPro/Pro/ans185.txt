Chlamydia is a curable bacterial infection that can be transmitted through 
genital, oral, or anal sex. It can also be passed from a woman to her baby 
during delivery. Infection with chlamydia can lead to ectopic pregnancy, 
preterm premature rupture of membranes (PPROM), and premature delivery. 
Mothers with untreated chlamydia may transmit the disease to their newborn 
leading to conjunctivitis or pneumonia.Chlamydia is treated with antibiotics that are safe to take during 
pregnancy. Patients who test positive are usually treated with azithromycin 
1 g orally in a single dose. The dose may be repeated in 2 - 3 weeks if 
infection is persistent.
