Drugs like oxycontin sometimes cause erectile dysfunction. Stopping 
oxycontin will often relieve the symptoms, however it may take time. I 
would suggest that your son see his doctor for further evaluation. His 
doctor may recommend that he take a medication such as Cialis(tadalafil), 
Levitra(vardenafil), or Viagra(sildenafil). Other non drug options include 
vacuum pump devices, penile prostheses and penile implants.
