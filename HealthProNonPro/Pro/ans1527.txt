There are certain signs you need to watch out for when your baby is having 
an illness. If you observe that your baby refuses feed, is unusually 
lethargic, has fever ( an oral temperature of 102 F 38.9 C) or higher, has 
loose or watery stools, multiple episodes of vomiting and hasn't wet the 
diaper for 6 or more hours, contact a doctor right away. In your case 
baby's case, due to the fact that she is lethargic, I would definitely 
advise having her checked by a pediatrician.
