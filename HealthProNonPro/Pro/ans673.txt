It is a well-known fact the link between Fluoroquinolones and Tendons 
problems. Cipro tendon ruptures can involve the Achilles heel, shoulder, 
hand, bicep or thumb. The risk of tendon ruptures or of Cipro tendonitis 
(tendinitis) increased in patients older than 60, people who have received 
kidney, heart or lung transplants, and people on steroid therapy. Tendon 
ruptures can occur in patients who do not have any of those risk factors 
and can also occur several months after patients finish their Cipro 
treatment. It is important for you at this point go to your appointment 
with the doctor, because neither codeine nor tramadol are drugs for a long 
term use. Your doctor will discuss with you your treatment options.
