Though breast tenderness could be a sign of pregnancy, if you think you are 
pregnant, you may want to do a home pregnancy test. All pregnancy tests 
work by detecting a hormone (HCG) in the urine. Home pregnancy tests are 
highly accurate if used correctly and at the right time. The test is best 
bone after 1 week of a missed period.
