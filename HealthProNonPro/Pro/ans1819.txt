Your itching could be caused due to an allergy to the tanning bed. Over the 
counter anti-histamines or topical corticosteriod creams will help relieve 
the symptoms of itching. Consider consulting a dermatologist if your 
symptoms worsen with treatment. For the time being avoid the tanning bed 
until your symptoms have resolved.
