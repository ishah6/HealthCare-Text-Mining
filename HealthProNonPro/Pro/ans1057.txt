Since your GP suspects that you may have prostatitis, the only way to 
determine the cause is to collect the prostate fluid for biochemical and 
microscopical analysis. The urologist may first perform a digital rectal 
examination to determine the different parts of the prostate and see for 
any evidence of abnormal hardening and calcification. If he finds some 
abnormality, then he may want to analyse the prostatic fluid. This involves 
the doctor squeezing the prostate to try to force out the prostatic fluid 
into the urethra. This process may be slightly discomforting in the 
presence of inflammation of the prostate. Also your doctor may collect a 
sample of the cells from the urethra to determine if there is presence of 
infection and plan treatment options accordingly. I hope that I have 
answered your query, take care.
