Not to much.  The worst part is getting them glued in.  They dry your teeth first, then pour some cement thing or something like that to help the brackets stick.  They then put the glue in, and then the brackets.  The wire being put through hurts a little if it touches your cheecks, but thats about it.

It hurts a little when your getting them in.  But, the pain wears off eventually, like in 4 or a little more days.  Everytime you get your rubber bands changed, the pain resets.  If you get elastics, then it will be pretty painful, so steer away from those unless you really need them.
