I do understand your concern. Penile discharge is commonly a sign of a 
sexually transmitted infection. Common causes of penile discharge are 
gonococcal urethritis, Chlamydia trachomatis and Trichomonas vaginalis. I 
would suggest that you see a doctor for prompt and accurate diagnosis and 
treatment. Penile discharge or urethritis is diagnosed a urethral swab or 
urine sample. The infecting organism might be identified from these samples.
