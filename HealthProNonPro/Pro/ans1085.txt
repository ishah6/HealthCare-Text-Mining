Studies have shown that patients on CPAP do gain weight in some cases. This 
might be a concern because obesity is one of the main concerns for sleep 
apnea. I would stress stress on an active weight loss plan. Lifestyle 
modification like adequate calorie intake and exercise will help to 
minimize the weight gain when on CPAP. I hope you find the information 
useful.
