It is important determine first if your wife was vaccinated in her 
childhood to establish if she has or not immunity, the same for you. 
Secondly, the diagnosis of Pertussis must be confirmed; the bacteria can be 
isolated from respiratory secretions or (less often) by large aerosol 
droplets from the respiratory tract of infected persons (at a range of 5 
feet or less). The culture of nasopharyngeal mucus is the “gold standard” 
for the diagnosis. Classic symptoms of pertussis include the characteristic 
whooping cough, vomiting, apnea, and cyanosis immediately after a paroxysm 
of coughing. The paroxysmal stage lasts 2 to 6 weeks and is followed by a 
convalescent stage during which nonparoxysmal cough may persist for many 
weeks, particularly during subsequent viral upper respiratory tract 
infections. The incubation period is 5 to 14 days, the disease may occur up 
to 21 days after exposure. If the diagnosis of Pertussis is confirmed on 
your wife, then you were exposed; Pertussis is highly contagious; secondary 
attack rates may exceed 80% among susceptible household contacts. I 
strongly recommend you to rule out a possible contagion before to proceed 
with the knee replacement. You should get provided postexposure prophylaxis 
because you were exposed. Again, all this in the case that the Pertussis 
diagnosis be confirmed in your wife.
