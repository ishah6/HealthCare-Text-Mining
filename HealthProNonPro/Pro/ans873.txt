Milroy disease is a rare disorder characterized by lower-limb lymphedema. 
The development of fluid collection in the extremities may hamper his 
mobility and his ability to lose weight. Improvement in swelling is usually 
possible with use of properly fitted compression hosiery and/or bandaging. 
Since Milroy is an inherited disorder, each child of an individual with 
Milroy disease has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease.
