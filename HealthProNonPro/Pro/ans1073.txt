Sometimes after extreme or inadequate movements a person may experience 
muscle spasms. Muscle spasms usually cause a temporary nuisance and 
typically resolve on their own without treatment. When muscle cramp or 
spasm continually recurs, it is time to seek an evaluation by a physician. 
The primary treatment of muscle spasms involves methods to relax the 
affected muscle. This typically involves stretching, massage, and heat 
application. Other treatments are directed toward the underlying cause of 
the muscle spasm and can include rehydration, electrolyte repletion, 
hormone treatment, calcium supplementation. Most spasms can be stopped if 
the involved muscle can be stretched.
