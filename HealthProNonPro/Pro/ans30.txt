A stye is an inflamed oil gland on the edge of your eyelid. Styes usually 
develop over a few days and may drain and heal on their own and no 
treatment is required. There is no treatment available to treat stye within 
a day. Treatment includes applying warm compresses for 10 minutes 4 times a 
day and antibiotic creams.
