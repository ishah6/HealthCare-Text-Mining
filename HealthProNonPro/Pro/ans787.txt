It is very difficult for me to explain the symptoms that your husband is 
going through. You have mentioned that your husband was on Lisinopril (ACE 
Inhibitor). One of the rare side effects of the drug is bone marrow 
suppression and neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. This may explain the low 
platelet, monocyte and neutrophils levels.It is most probably that this decreased immunity would have led to a viral 
infection causing the peripheral neuropathy. However you husband's doctor 
may also investigate for other causes of peripheral neuropathy like chronic 
kidney disease, low vitamin B12 levels and hypothyroidism.
