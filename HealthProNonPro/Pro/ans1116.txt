Thank you for your question. A blue colour to the lips in young infants is 
indeed a cause for concern. This is caused by a condition known as 
cyanosis. In infants, cyanosis could be a symptom of a congenital heart 
defect that causes the reduction of oxygenated blood flow to various parts 
of the body. We strongly recommend that you take your granddaughter to 
consult a pediatric cardiologist in order to determine the cause of 
cyanosis. Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
