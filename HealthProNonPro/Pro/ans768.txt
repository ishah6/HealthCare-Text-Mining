It is sometimes difficult to tell the difference between the two. Tension 
headache as the name suggests is caused by stress, decreased calorie 
intake, and alcohol. It is caused by increased muscle tension of the scalp 
and neck causing pain. Whereas migraines may be caused by a chemical 
changes in the brain leading to decreased seratonin and dilatation of 
vessels in the brain. Tension headaches are probably more common and is 
usually described as a band like pressure around the head whereas migraines 
on the other hand tend to to be located on one side of the head and can 
present with aura (light flashes, nausea). Your symptoms are most probably 
due to a tension headache. General management of both these headaches are 
similar which consist of NSAIDs (motrin or advil), rest, ice packs or a 
long, hot shower.
