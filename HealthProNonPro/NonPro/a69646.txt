Make a list of all of the things u need to do and post signs in ur house or little reminders to make sure u get them done. Create an agenda and highlight things that u have completed. It will give u a greater sense of organization and hopefully itll stop ur habit of procrastination. Unplug ur computer if u have to, or limit ur time on going on the Internet. Have an alarm set to go off for 1 hour and then shut ur computer down and get back to work. Take short breaks if necessary, to keep ur energy up. Good blessings!
