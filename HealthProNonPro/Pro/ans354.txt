Headache that present after waking up, is associated with vomiting and 
temporary loss of vision needs to be investigated urgently. I would advise 
you not to overlook your symptoms and delay your appointment with your 
doctor. Meningitis or possible a blockage in the arteries supplying the 
brain may present with similar symptoms.The best step is to consult your doctor or go to the ER. Complete 
blood-work, CT scan of the brain and possibly an analysis of the spinal 
fluid will be required to make a definitive diagnosis.
