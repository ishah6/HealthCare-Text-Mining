I do understand your concern. Heartburn may be caused by reflux and is 
caused by acid content of the stomach moving into the oesophagus. Umbilical 
on the other hand is a result of of weak abdominal muscles causing the 
intestines to push through the belly button. Both these condition and 
unrelated. You may require antacids and medication like H2 blockers or 
proton pump inhibitors for the management of reflex. Surgical correction of 
umbilical hernia will depend on the extent and size of the hernia. Smaller 
hernias with no symptoms sometimes can be watched. Without surgery, there 
is a risk that some fat or part of the intestine will get stuck 
(incarcerated) in the hernia and become impossible to push back in. This is 
usually painful. If the blood supply to this area is cut off 
(strangulation), urgent surgery is needed.
