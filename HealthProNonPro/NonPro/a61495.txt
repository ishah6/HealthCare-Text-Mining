I dont know about your sex life but he sounds rather inconsiderate there, my husband would never do the things that you describe and also threatening to leave you because of some minor sex problems seems a bit shallow. The thing that would be bothering me more than anything is the drinking, I hate men who drink, and they often dont remember things properly the next day, put all the blame on you and screw with your mind, giving you guit trips and so on. He sounds quite manipulative. You should see this as a chance to get out, if he is blaming you for his problems now you are on a road to nowhere.  Just my advise, sorry for the long answer but was a long question, good luck x
