If you choose to be sexually active, condoms may lower the risk of HPV. To 
be most effective, condoms should be used with every sex act, from start to 
finish. Condoms may also lower the risk of developing HPV-related diseases, 
such as genital warts and cervical cancer. But HPV can infect areas that 
are not covered by a condom - so condoms may not fully protect against HPV 
infection.
