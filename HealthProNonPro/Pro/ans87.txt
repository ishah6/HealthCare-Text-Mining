Altering the normal physiology of menstruation is a tricky affair and most 
doctors will advice you to keep menstruation free and unhampered. Your 
bleeding in between periods could be the result of a side effect of the 
drug. However, there are certain situations when one will find an extreme 
need to postpone menstruation. You can continue taking the oral 
contraceptive pill, take the first set - skip the placebo pills and 
immediately start on the next cycle of pills.
