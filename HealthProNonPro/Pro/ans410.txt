I do understand that you are concerned for your brother's health. Tolerance 
and physical and psychologic dependence on opioid usually occur after three 
weeks of daily usage. Although all opioids can cause addiction, heroin 
(brown sugar) has the greatest addictive potential. The discontinuation of 
opioids leads to a constellation of withdrawal symptoms which include :Stage I (up to 8 hours) - fear of withdrawal, anxiety and drug craving.Stage II (8 - 24 hours) - insomnia, restlessness, anxiety, stomach cramps, 
increased sweating and dilated pupils.Stage III (up to 3 days) - vomiting, diarrhea, fever, chills, tremors, 
tachycardia, hypertension and seizures.The severity of its symptoms depends upon the type and frequency of the 
drug used. In general, abrupt discontinuation is not recommended due to the 
above mentioned effects. Management of opioid withdrawal should be done 
under supervision and I would suggest that you take your brother to a 
detoxification centres/facility that is capable in dealing with heroin 
withdrawal.
