While taking amoxicillin, your child may develop an upset stomach as a side 
effect of this medication. Amoxicillin can cause your child to develop 
diarrhea. Diarrhea can cause your child to excrete watery or loose stools. 
I would not be concerned about the color and contents of your child`s stool 
if he is feeding well, wetting his diapers and is alert. If these symptoms 
last after stopping the antibiotics, consult your child`s doctor.
