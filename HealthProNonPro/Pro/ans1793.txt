You sustained a head trauma and the symptoms that you described: headache, 
nausea are expected, apparently you do not have fracture, although the only 
way to rule out for sure this is with X-rays. Possibly during the crash 
against the wall, the frontal nerve, specifically the supraorbital branch 
(just above the eye) might be injured and now you are experiencing a 
post-traumatic Neuralgia, this cause pain and tenderness in the notch or 
traject of the nerve, without side shift. The treatment is at first, 
conservative with anti-inflammatory medication, vitamin B complex, and 
local capsaicin cream , when it is applied to the skin, capsaicin cream has 
been found to deplete substance P ( neurochemical that transmits pain) 
which desensitizes a person to pain. Capsaicin cream produces a temporary 
reduction in pain, so it must be used regularly to provide prolonged pain 
relief. You have to be patient because this is a long process until the 
affected nerve heals. If the conservative treatment produces poor or no 
results, then, a nerve block may be tried.
