The healing time after the trauma or muscle contusion varies from patient 
to patient and also depends on the extension and severity of the initial 
injury. If contusions are minor , they tend to heal quickly, but, severe 
contusions can cause deep tissue damage and may take longer and possibly 
lead to complications. Contusions occur when a direct blow or repeated 
blows from a blunt object strike part of the body, crushing underlying 
muscle fibers and connective tissue without breaking the skin. A contusion 
can result from falling or jamming the body against a hard surface. 
Sometimes a pool of blood collects within damaged tissue, forming a lump 
over the injury (hematoma).In severe cases, swelling and bleeding beneath 
the skin may cause shock. Contusions cause swelling and pain and limit 
joint range of motion near the injury. Torn blood vessels may cause bluish 
discoloration. The injured muscle may feel weak and stiff. I recommend at 
these, try to keep the muscle in a gentle stretch position, and consult a 
specialist if the symptoms worsen or persist.
