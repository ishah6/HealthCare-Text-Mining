It is common to have vaginal discharge during pregnancy. This is known as 
leukorrhea and is due to the increased blood flow in the vaginal area due 
to pregnancy. The discharge is often clear and non-smelling. If you 
experience that your discharge is increasing, is causing you discomfort 
such as pain with urination, soreness, itching, or burning, developing a 
foul smell or the discharge becomes frothy or yellow, green, or gray, 
contact your doctor right away.
