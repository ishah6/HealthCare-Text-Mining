Love handles are those slightly 
pudgy, icky folds of fat found on 
the lower part of the abdomen, 
mainly visible along the sides of 
the back, just above the waist
area.  

When ladies wear bras that are
much too tight, you can see the 
folds of this fat right below 
their bra line.  These are 
"love handles." Handles, because
you can hold onto them, though I 
dont know why anyone would want
to do so.  :)

Love handles can be visible on 
men too.  My dog, Spunky, he 
was just neutered, so now he
has them too. (Going to have
to help him work on that).
Hes rather cute and love 
handle on a 18 pound Lhasa-Yorkie
are not healthy!

It is slanguage for a certain type
of body fat that most everyone 
seems to want to lose these days.

Ive lost my love handles!  But 
Im not about to search for them 
again. I dont want them back, 
thanks.
