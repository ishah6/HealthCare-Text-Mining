Thank you for your question. Your overactive bladder in the absence of any 
urinary tract infections as indicated could be caused by several 
etiologies. The first could be anatomic. The uterus can sometimes prolapse, 
or descend downward resulting in pressure on the bladder which can lead to 
a sensation of fullness and increased urinary frequency. Overactive bladder 
can also be caused by dysfunction of the muscle sphincters of the bladder 
which control the passage of urine into the urethra when it is voided. 
Lastly, overactive bladder can also be caused by disruption of the nerves 
that control the urination reflex. At this point, we can only be certain 
that your overactive bladder is not being caused by an infection, so we 
recommend that you follow up with a urologist for further evaluation to 
determine the cause of theses symptoms.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
