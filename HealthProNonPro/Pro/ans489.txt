I do understand your concern. Antibody test for HIV infection are based on 
detection of immunoglobulin (IgG) antibodies against HIV-1 and HIV-2. 
Usually these antibodies appear within 6-12 months following initial 
infection but can even take 9-12 months in some individuals. Recently a new 
antibody assay test was introduced that decreased the window period in 
detecting the HIV infection. Using the p24 antigen and HIV antibody 
combination, acute HIV infection can be diagnosed before the development of 
HIV specific antibodies. Since your tests have come negative it may be safe 
to say that you do not have the infection.
