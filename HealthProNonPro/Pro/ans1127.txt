Thank you for your question. Based on the details you have provided the 
answer to your question is Yes on all accounts. Unprotected sexual activity 
involving exposure to semen and anal sex (attempted) are all very high risk 
exposure to sexually transmitted infections such as HIV. We recommend that 
you proceed to your doctor and conduct a complete STI check up and testing, 
including a blood test for HIV infection. In the future, please use barrier 
protection such as condoms when engaging in sexual activity.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
