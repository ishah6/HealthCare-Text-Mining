Restylane has not been tested in pregnant or breast-feeding women so I will 
not be able to tell you its effects in pregnancy. You may have to consult 
with your health care provider for the risks, pro and cons of restylane. In 
my opinion it is better to avoid any procedure or drug during the first 
trimester.
