Your symptoms of throat pain, cough and fever are suggestive of a viral 
infection. This can be best managed with plenty of fluids, plenty of rest 
and tylenol (paracetamol). You may also perform steam inhalation to sooth 
your respiratory tract and reduce congestion. If your symptoms don`t 
improve with these measures, I would suggest that you see your doctor.
