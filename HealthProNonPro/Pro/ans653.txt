Infections of the nail fold can be caused by bacteria, fungi and some 
viruses. A break in the nail makes it easy for a bacterial infection. This 
type of infection is characterized by pain, redness and swelling of the 
nail folds. People who have their hands in water for extended periods may 
develop this condition.You may need to see a dermatologist to rule out a 
fungal, bacterial infection or psoriasis that results in splitting of the 
nails.
