Ritalin (methylphenidate) is an amphetamine-like prescription stimulant 
commonly used to treat Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in 
children and adults. Ongoing research shows early-life use of Ritalin 
(methylphenidate) has complex effects that endure later into life. Ritalin 
in young children may later disrupt development of brain cells in the 
hippocampus, region of the brain critical to memory, spatial navigation, 
and behaviorial inhibition. Damage can lead to memory problems, 
disorientation and depression in adulthood.
