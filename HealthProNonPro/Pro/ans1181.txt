Thank you for your question. It is possible that you could be experiencing 
a transient episode of fluid overload due to the iv saline you have 
received. When IV saline is administered, it dilutes the blood, and as a 
result, excess fluid is moved to to the interstitial space of the body 
(i.e. the tissues of the extremities, and abdomen). This results in 
swelling, bloating, and edema. This could also account for the feelings you 
are experiencing. After a few days your body should remove this excess 
fluid without complication. If you continue to feel this way after about 
4-5 days, we recommend that you see your doctor to be examined to determine 
if you require any further treatment.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
