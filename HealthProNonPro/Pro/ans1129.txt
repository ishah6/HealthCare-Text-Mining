Thank you for your question. Based on your brief description it is possible 
that this bruise could be the development of a cyst of some sort. What 
leads us to give you this hypothesis is that there is a centrally located 
white spot, which is indicative of a puncta, or the area of the opening of 
the sebaceous gland. We recommend that you have your doctor examine this 
area once more for the possibility of a sebaceous cyst.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
