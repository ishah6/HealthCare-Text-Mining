Thank you for your question. The only way to be certain that you have a 
congenital absence of your anterior talofibular ligament is by MRI of your 
ankle. Palpation alone, even by the most skilled orthopedic surgeons, 
cannot provide an accurate diagnosis of this. We recommend that you consult 
an orthopedic surgeon who will examine you and perform the appropriate 
diagnostic tests to determine the cause of your ankle condition. We hope 
you feel better.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
