The symptoms that your mom is experiencing is due to tonsillitis. Since she 
is having sore throat, fever, cold chills and a whitish exudate on the 
tonsils, it is important for her to see an ENT specialist to rule out Group 
A Streptococcal infection. The white stuff that you see on the tonsils is 
due to exudates caused by a strep infection. It would be worthwhile to have 
a doctor take a throat culture at a time when the white spots are very 
prominent. Appropriate antibiotic treatment may be necessary in the 
presence of infection.
