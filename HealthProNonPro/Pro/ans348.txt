Hand foot and mouth disease is caused by coxsackie virus. The symptoms 
include fever, painful oral lesions, body rash with sores and diarrhea.Adults are usually immune to the virus. During pregnancy, an infection may 
cause a small risk for miscarriage and if your wife is in the third 
trimester, she could pass the infection to her child if she had the 
infection. Frequent washing of hands and wearing latex gloves during 
changing diapers decreases the chances of infection.
