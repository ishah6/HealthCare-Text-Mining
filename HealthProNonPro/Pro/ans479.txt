I do understand your concern, symptoms of chest pain cause great anxiety to 
someone who is experiencing it. Though pain in the chest may be a result of 
conditions affecting the lungs, stomach, pancreas, oesophagus, muscle, bone 
and skin. It is essential to rule out myocardial infarction which is an 
acute emergency. I wold advise you to see your family doctor for a complete 
physical examination. Depending on your symptoms and presentation chest 
pain, your doctor may order an electrocardiogram, chest x-ray and 
biochemical markers for MI.
