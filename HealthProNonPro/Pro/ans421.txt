I do understand you concern for weight gain. It is difficult for me to say 
what is causing your weight gain. If health lifestyle, diet and exercise 
does not help in weight loss, I would advise you to consult your doctor for 
a possibility of an underlying problem such as hypothyroidism and PCOS. It 
may also help to speak to a dietitian to assess your current diet. I hope 
this information helps, take care.
