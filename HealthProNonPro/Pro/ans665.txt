Irregular periods and lengthening of the the cycle could be an indication 
of approaching menopause. During the early perimenopausal stage, it is 
generally see that the cycle length decrease in length. Eventually, the 
cycle length widens and skipping menses typically occurs. The changes in 
the cycle length may be associated with heavier than normal flow followed 
by a lighter flow and occasional spotting in later perimenopause. A common 
reason for the late periods and prolonged bleeding is due to anovulation, 
which is ovulation without the egg being released. When this occurs, there 
is no signal to the body to cause a period. As irregular periods during 
menopause are related to low estrogen levels, the best way to overcome 
irregular periods is dealing with hormonal imbalance. The major types of 
treatment options include lifestyle changes and medical therapy. Irregular 
periods caused by fatigue, stress, and poor physical health should be 
corrected by adopting a healthy lifestyle. I hope this helps, I wish you 
well, take care.
