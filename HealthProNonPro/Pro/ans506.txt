I do understand your concern. It might be difficult to recognize the signs 
and symptoms of pregnancy if you become pregnant while taking oral 
contraceptive pills. If you're concerned because you took birth control 
pills before you knew you were pregnant, I would like to assure you that 
there's little risk. I hope this helps, take care.
