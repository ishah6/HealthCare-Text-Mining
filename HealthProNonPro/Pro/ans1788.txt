You might be experiencing a mechanical upper back pain, produced by the 
straining of that segment of the spine, you probably are not stretching 
adequately before beginning your physical activities and this adds more 
stress to an affected area not totally healed. The conservative treatment 
of the upper back pain is basically relative rest of the spinal segment 
involved, avoiding all the activities that produce pain or discomfort, such 
as weight lifting. Also very important is the reeducation to keep a good 
posture at all times. Control of the pain and inflammation with Ice, 
transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS), and anti-inflammatory 
drugs (such as ibuprofen). Keep a consistent exercise routine with 
stretching and extension-flexion which may reduce tension and stress to the 
spinal joints. A home program is developed within the tolerance and ability 
in order to encourage continued exercise.
