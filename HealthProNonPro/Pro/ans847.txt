Maybe you performed an extreme movement that produced a muscle spasm in the 
intercostal area or in some way the intercostal nerve got injured and now 
you are experiencing an Intercostal neuritis, which is often associated 
with injury or inflammation of the nerves, muscles, cartilage and ligaments 
in the rib cage and middle spine area. Intercostal neuralgia may resolve by 
its own or it may require treatment. The suggested strategy would be: 
please, try to be patient and do not expect an overnight improvement, take 
anti inflammatory medication and also Vitamin B complex supplement. Local 
moist heat helps to ease the pain. An again, try to avoid activities that 
worsen the pain. If the pain persist the next step would be a nerve block.
