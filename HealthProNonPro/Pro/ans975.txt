shortness of breath. Panic disorder can be effectively treated by 
medication and/or cognitive behavioral therapy. Treatment of panic disorder 
varies depending upon the stage of development of the patient’s disorder.

effective than placebo for panic disorder. These include :Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI)Serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRI)Tricyclic antidepressants (TCA)BenzodiazepinesMonoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOI)Cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) and antidepressant medication have been 
shown in controlled trials to be equally effective in the treatment of 
panic disorder. Your doctor may recommend either CBT or medication
