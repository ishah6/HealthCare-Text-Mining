The suggestions that have been given by others are very good. I do think you might want to see a dermatologist, though. If your skin actually flakes, especially if it is in the folds of skin (eyelids, nasal folds) or around eyebrows you might have seborrheic dermatitis. This is a type of skin disorder that causes red, itchy flaky patches on the skin.

Hope this helps.
