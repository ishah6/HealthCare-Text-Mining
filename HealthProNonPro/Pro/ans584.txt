I would not worry about one single patch white hair. Hair gets its color 
due to a pigment called melanin which is produced by the body. Many a times 
some hair can lack that pigment and thus look white. You may also see your 
doctor to rule out vitiligo as the cause of whitening of hair. All the best.
