Recurrent pregnancy loss is a heart-wrenching experience for a parent and I 
understand your concern. Most cases of early pregnancy loss (termination of 
pregnancy before 20 weeks) are unrecognised.There can exist more than 1 cause of early pregnancy loss. Genetic factors 
(aneuploidy, mendelian disorders), immunologic causes, anatomic problems, 
infections (TORCH group), endocrine and environmental causes have all been 
known to cause pregnancy loss.Most spontaneous miscarriages are caused by an abnormal karyotype of the 
embryo. Recurrent miscarriages may result from recurrent chromosomal 
abnormalities of the embryo which is not inherited or a structural 
abnormality inherited from one parent.I would advise you to consult your doctor for further examination and 
evaluation. If a suspected genetic cause of miscarriage is thought of, the 
standard of care is to offer genetic counseling. Because advanced age 
increases the risk of an abnormal karyotype in a conceptus, amniocentesis 
is routinely offered for all pregnant women of advanced maternal age, which 
is defined as women older than 35 years. I wish you well, and hope I could 
answer some of your queries.
