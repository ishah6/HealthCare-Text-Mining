I do understand your concern. What your doctor is trying to identify by 
doing and endoscopy is do determine the damage to the lower end of the 
esophagus by the reflux. There is sometimes a change in the characteristics 
of the normal cells in the oesophagus wherein the normal squamous cells are 
replaced by columnar cells. Though there is a risk of developing cancer of 
the esophagus due to this change, with adequate treatment a reversal is 
possible. I hope the information helps, take care.
