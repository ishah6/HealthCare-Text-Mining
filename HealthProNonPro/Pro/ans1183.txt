Thank you for your question. It is possible that you have contracted an 
infection of the glans penis and urethral meatus due to your excessive 
masturbation. This is referred to as balanitis. This will be best treated 
after being examined by a doctor and starting a course of topical 
antibiotic cream which will clear the infection and treat the pain and 
inflammation. Please see your doctor.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
