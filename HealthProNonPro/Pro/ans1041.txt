Scoliosis is the lateral deviation of the spine, if you already have 
completed the bone growth, the risk of progression of the deviation 
(scoliosis) is low. The development of the deformity takes years and 
usually is diagnosed by a pediatrician or an orthopedic surgeon with 
special imaging studies. Anyways, I strongly recommend you practicing some 
sport as swimming that may strengthening the muscles of your spine, regular 
work out in the gym with stretching exercises and to strengthen abs too, 
keep your weight under control and keep regular appointments, every six 
months with an orthopedic surgeon to monitor possible progression of the 
curve.
