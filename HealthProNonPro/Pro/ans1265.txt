Thank you for your question. This sensation you have been experiencing for 
the last two days could actually be due to a urinary tract infection. This 
may actually be a sub-clinical manifestation of a full urinary tract 
infection, which would involve painful urination, blood in the urine with 
discharge. It is possible for your symptoms to worsen for the next few 
days. What we suggest, is that you wait for about 36-48 hours to see if 
your develop the symptoms of a full UTI please see your doctor to start a 
course of antibiotic treatment. Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
