It is difficult for me to comment on the cause of your problem. Based on 
symptoms alone, I would think of post tubal ligation syndrome. This is 
caused as a result of a rapid decline of estrogen/progesterone hormone 
levels caused by decreased blood supply to the ovaries after surgery. 
Symptoms include Irregular periods; shorter, lighter periods; heavier 
periods, flooding; phantom periods, shorter cycles, longer cycles, hot 
flashes, dry and itchy vagina and mood swings. I would advise you to 
observe your periods and if they continue to be irregular, I would 
recommend that you see your doctor to rule out any underlying pathology.
