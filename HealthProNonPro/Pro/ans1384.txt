The Master Cleanse is a liquid lemonade diet that is supposed to remove 
toxins from the body (though there is no scientific evidence). This regimen 
is popular these days in people who want to lose weight rapidly.I would not recommend you the Master Cleanse diet because it deprives the 
body of vital and essential nutrients and the weight loss is not 
sustainable in the long run. In addition your symptoms may not benefit from 
Master Cleanse. In my opinion I would suggest that you consult a 
gastroenterologist for further evaluation to rule out irritable bowel 
syndrome. Your doctor may also do a colonoscopy to visualize the gut 
mucosa. I hope the information helps.
