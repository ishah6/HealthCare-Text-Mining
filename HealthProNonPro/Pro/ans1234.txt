Thank you for your question. The sensation you are experiencing could be do 
periodic muscle spasms. This could be stress/anxiety related, or due to a 
problem with the nerves supplying the muscles of the vagina. This can also 
be caused by prolonged sitting for extended periods of time. This puts 
pressure on the pudendal nerve which when relieved can result in periodic 
fasciculations of the muscles lining the vagina. Try to reduce the amount 
of time you spend sitting to see if this helps with your symptoms. Should 
this not help, we recommend that you have a Gynaecologist perform a pelvic 
examination to determine what could be causing this peculiar manifestation. 
Should you develop any pain, or bleeding, or develop the inability to 
engage in sexual intercourse, please see you doctor immediately.AskTheDoctor.com appreciates you consulting us with your medical question.
