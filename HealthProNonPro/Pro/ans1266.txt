Thank you for your question. This sharp pain you are experiencing could be 
related to a the sensory nerves innervating this area of your scalp. The 
area you have described is innervated by the third branch of the fifth 
cranial nerve called the mandibular nerve. This pain may be due to a form 
of temporo-mandibular dysfunction, or impingement of a part of the 
mandibular nerve which supplies the area above the ear. It is important 
that you have this examined by your doctor in order to determine what is 
actually causing this pain, and if it can potentially become worse. You may 
need to undergo an a physical examination to test for trigger points that 
my elicit your pain as well as have an MRI study conducted in order to rule 
out if there are any structures such as tumors or enlarged blood vessels 
compressing the trigeminal nerve, which is being manifested in this pain.
