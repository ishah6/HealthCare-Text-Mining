Liver fuction tests life AST, ALT and Triglycerides can be elevated because 
of many reasons. Inflammation or damage to the liver due to infection, 
disease, toxins, drugs and alcohol may cause derangement in the values. 
Other pathologies like biliary tract disease, gallstones, may also cause 
rise in LFTs. An ultrasound of the abdomen may be required to rule out fatty liver and 
obstruction of the gall bladder due to stones or stricture. Try avoiding 
overuse of over the counter drugs, minimize alcohol intake and eat lots of 
leafy greens and vegetables. You may want to repeat the blood test after a 
few months to make sure they are back to the normal range.
