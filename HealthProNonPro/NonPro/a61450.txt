Sugar cannot be healthy.  Sugar cane can be healthy and so can sugar beets, which most of the sugar in the U.S. comes from.  This means that the plants have a good state of health.  Sugar is an inert substance, without life, therefore it cannot experience health, being healthy.  What youre really asking is how much sugar is healthful as part of daily intake.  Even that question is badly written and I suggest that you learn some more about writing.  The answer is, though, as little as possible, not as much as one can.  I say this after many years of reading alternative materials about diet.  Only sap and honey used as sweeteners are healthful.  Any kind of refined sugar, used more than very minimally, upsets the bodily system in ways that science doesnt even want to address.

Again, the answer is that the daily quantity ingested should be as minimal, even none, as one can make it.
