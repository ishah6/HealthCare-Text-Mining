Synthroid contains levothyroxine, a thyroid hormone supplement used to 
treat people with hypothyroidism. Levothyroxine helps to such as weight 
gain, sensitivity to cold, lack of energy, and dry skin.Synthroid must be prescribed by your doctor as it may lead to side effects 
if not used properly. Signs of toxicity of the drug may include chest pain, 
increased heart rate, palpitations, excessive sweating, heat intolerance, 
and nervousness. I would suggest that your sister consult her doctor before 
taking the medication.
