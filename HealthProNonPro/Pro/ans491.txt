I do understand your concern. During times of stress or infection the level 
of cortisol in the body increases. Cortisol is a hormone that regulates 
glucose metabolism in the body. High levels of cortisol in the body causes 
hyperglycemia, thus increasing the level of insulin required by your body.I would suggest that yo consult your doctor for management of the viral 
infection which the cause of increased insulin requirement.
