Intermenstrual bleeding may be seen in the first three months of using an 
oral contraceptive pill. Intermenstrual bleeding in OCP users may also be 
due to noncompliance or the use of low-dose pills.The differential diagnosis for intermenstrual bleeding is extensive. 
Pregnancy, systemic illnesses, and structural lesions should be ruled out 
by history, physical examination, and laboratory evaluation. The other 
common causes could be uterine fibroids or cervical or uterine polyps, 
changes in hormone levels and hypothyroidism.You may need to get your thyroid levels to rule out hypothyroidism as the 
cause of your intermenstrual bleed.
