It has been just one week after your surgery and at this point you should 
not be stressing your knee. The standard rehab protocol post ACL 
reconstructive surgery, is about 4-6 weeks using crutches, non bearing 
weight period. After these 6 weeks you will start progressively to bear 
weight on the affected knee, and range of motion exercises 
(flexion-extension), along with quads straightening, and hamstring 
stretches. It will be expected some inflammation and pain when you start 
the exercise routine, but you will control these with anti inflammatory 
medication (“Aleve”, “Motrin”).
