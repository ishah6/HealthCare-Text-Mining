This is a very difficult phase that you are going through, being told that 
one has HIV is very distressing and I can relate to your concern. Most of 
the screening HIV test nowadays produce accurate results, of course there 
is another kind of test, confirmatory test: Western Blot, which is usually 
done when the screening test comes out positive. For most of the people 
antibodies to HIV take 6 weeks to 3 months to develop, sometimes, in very 
rare cases, may take up to 6 months. For this reason, getting tested before 
3 months have passed may result in an unclear test result, as the infected 
person may not yet have developed antibodies to HIV. These 3 – 6 months are 
known as the 'window period'. Many people do not show symptoms after they 
first get infected with HIV. Others have a flu-like illness within several 
days to weeks after exposure to the virus. Since two ELISA tests have been 
negative, your chances of being tested positive in a repeat Western Blot or 
a Viral Load PCR is low. I hope I could clear some of your doubts and 
concerns.
