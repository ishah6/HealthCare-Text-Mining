Thank you for your question. This painless red lesion at the urethral 
meatus could be an inflamed sebaceous gland which is relatively benign and 
can resolve without complication on its own. It can also be caused by an 
eruption of herpes. Even though you haven't had sexual intercourse in over 
a year, the herpes simplex virus can remain dormant within the body for 
many years without symptoms. We recommend that, while this lesion is 
present you have it examined and tested by your doctor to determine the 
exact cause of it.Thank you for choosing AskTheDocotor.com
