Delayed onset muscle soreness is very commonly seen after unaccustomed 
heavy work. This may be caused due to small microscopic tears in the muscle 
fibres after strenuous exercise. The best treatment option in your case 
would be to give rest to the muscle and avoid lifting weights. Non 
steroidal anti-inflammatory medication will also help to reduce the 
inflammation.
