Thank you for your question. Mucus is usually a clear semiviscous substance 
produced within the intestine, rectum, and anal canal. You have described 
your discharge as yellow. This could be pus. This concerns us that you may 
have contracted an STD or developed an infection of the anal canal. Since 
you asserted that your discharge was only a small amount, therefore it is 
likely that this possible infection will resolve on its own without 
complication. If however, you notice that you are developing excessive pain 
in the anal region, as well as a fever. Please seek medical attention 
immediately to be examined and start the necessary treatment.
