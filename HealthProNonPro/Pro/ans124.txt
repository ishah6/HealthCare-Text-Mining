Azithromycin may be beneficial in cases of gonococcal urethritis or 
infection caused by chlamydia. However uncomplicated cystitis may be better 
managed with bactrim, ciprofloxacin or augmentin. I would advise you to 
consult your doctor and get a urinalysis. You should start treatment only 
in the presence of infection.
