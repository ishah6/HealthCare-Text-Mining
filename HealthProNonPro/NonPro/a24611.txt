Second hand smoke (sometimes called environmental tobacco smoke)does absolutely no harm to anyone.  The WHO (World Health Organization)in fact did a study which found that second hand smoke was actually protective for lung cancer, on kids who grew up in a smoking home.  The EPA meta study of 1993 has been widely quoted to indicate that second hand smoke was dangerous, but the truth is, any respectable scientific journal and any respectable scientist, would tell you that these studies did not prove any correlation between second hand smoke and disease.  One study has showed that those exposed to second hand smoke at home and at work, only are taking in the equivalent of smoking 6 cigarettes a year.  The EPA itself, believed that second hand smoke amounts to the equivalent of smoking 1/5 of one cigarette per day.  This is probably a gross exaggeration.  But either way, this level of exposure to tobacco smoke causes no harm.  The antismoking nazis have no rational basis for their strange quest to rid the world of tobacco smokers. Stop following the latest politically correct fad, such as being an antismoking nazi; stop believing politicians, lawyers, and school teachers; stop following the mob;  and start studying and learning how to think rationally.
