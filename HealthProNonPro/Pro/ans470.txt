I do understand your concern, but unfortunately there is no effective 
treatment that will effectively eliminate cold sores. Cold sores are caused 
by herpes simplex type 1 virus and the infection usually last 2-3 weeks and 
subsides on its own. However drugs like acyclovir, famciclovir and 
valacyclovir (all antiviral) are known to decrease the duration of the 
infection.However, since your treatment with abreva is not helping you, I would 
advise consulting with your doctor to rule out an underlying bacterial 
infection.
