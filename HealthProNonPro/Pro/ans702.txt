It is difficult for me to say whether you are pregnant or not. The bleeding 
could be your regular period or an implantation bleed. To see whether you 
are pregnant you may need to do a urine pregnancy test. You should perform 
this test after 2 week after you've had unprotected sex and do the test in 
the morning. You can also do a blood test for pregnancy which can be done 
earlier and is more sensitive. I hope I have answered your question, take 
care.
