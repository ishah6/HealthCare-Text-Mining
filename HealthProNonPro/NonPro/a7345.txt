Any amount of cancer is a bad thing -- it is a serious thing and warrants medical intervention. ASAP!

If you are asking about prognosis, there are lots of variables in play as to prognosis of the person you know (I am assuming it is you for the remainder of the answer). Lots of things can enter the equation -- general physical health, specific type of cancer, other health conditions, where it has spread to (if any), treatment choices, age, nutrition, etc. And it is important to remember that lots of people survive breast cancer. 

I would start by seeing a medical oncologist and/or oncologic surgeon -- ideally one who tends to focus on breast cancers. They will be in the best position to offer treatment alternatives and outlooks. Think about what questions you want to answer and write them down before you go. Take someone with you -- task them with being sure all of your questions get asked and have them take notes. Dont hesitate to ask the doctor to slow down or provide more information. If you are interested in prognosis and treatment alternatives -- ask! Some patients seem to prefer less information in that area and some mds wait for the topic to be brought up.

Odds are that they will need to conduct additional tests (to determine the specific type and to see if it has spread).  That is normal.
