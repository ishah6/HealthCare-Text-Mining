Pain in the tongue could be a symptom of glossitis. Glossitis may occur by 
itself, or it may be caused by a variety of diseases, disorders and 
conditions. Bacterial, yeast and viral infections can lead to glossitis. 
Other causes of a glossitis include exposure to irritants, canker sores, 
iron deficiency anemia, poor oral hygiene and weakened immune system. I 
would suggest that you see your doctor for a complete examination and 
further blood-work depending on the findings. I wish you well, take care.
