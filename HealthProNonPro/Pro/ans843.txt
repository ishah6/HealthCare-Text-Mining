Many women experience abdominal pain after hysterectomy but most recover 
within a year. The most common cause of these abdominal pain are due to 
adhesions and endometriosis.The adhesions are formed after surgery as th ebody heals after trauma or 
surgery. These adhesions may bind and restrict the movements of structures 
that were previously mobile. I would suggest that you consult your doctor 
to rule out adhesion and also other causes of pain abdomen.
