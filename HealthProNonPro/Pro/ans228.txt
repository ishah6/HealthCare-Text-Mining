Dextran increases the blood sugar levels but also increase your risk for 
bleeding because of its anti-thrombotic effects. I would advise you to use 
alternative methods of weight loss. Lifestyle modifications, reduced 
calorie intake and regular exercise may provide better results than any 
herbal medication.
