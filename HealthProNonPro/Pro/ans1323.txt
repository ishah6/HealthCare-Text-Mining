The cause of your throat pain could be due to drying and irritation the 
mucosa of the soft palate and uvula due to snoring. It may also be caused 
due to an acid reflux. If lifestyle modifications like proper diet, 
exercise, weight loss and antacids do not help, you may need to consult 
your doctor to rule out sleep apnea.
