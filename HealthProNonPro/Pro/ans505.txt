I do understand your concern. It is unlikely that Paxil would have caused 
you to have a bad underarm odor. Sometimes change in diet and certain food 
could cause body odor. I would advise that you monitor your diet to try to 
see which foods cause an increase in symptoms. Continue using deodorants 
and frequent change of clothing .
