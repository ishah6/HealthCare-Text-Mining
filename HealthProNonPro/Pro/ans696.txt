It is difficult for me to say what could be the cause of your poor short 
term memory. Whether these problems are due to medical causes or stress may 
need to be investigated by your doctor. I would advise that you try 
lifestyle modifications that involves decreasing stress, eating a healthy 
balanced diet, regular exercise and keeping a diary for maintaining lists. 
If these measures do not help then I strongly recommend you to consult a 
Neurologist. I wish you well, take care.
