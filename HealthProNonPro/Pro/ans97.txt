An important part about the patellofemoral syndrome or chondrolamalacia 
patella is the muscular imbalance that increases the friction between the 
patella and the lower part of the femur, causing a wear out of the 
cartilage located in the back of the patella producing that uncomfortable 
situation that you described. You could try the following: taping or 
bandaging the superior pole of the patella, so that the inferior patella 
imposes less mass effect on the underlying intra-articular fat pad, or you 
can wear a soft knee brace that helps to control the patella position also 
try to modifying activities that increase the uncomfortable sensation. 
Stretching the quadriceps and hip flexor muscles may help to lessen some of 
the downward pressure the patella applies to the intra articular fat pad.
