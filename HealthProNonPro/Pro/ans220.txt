Definately from your symptoms alone, this sounds like a stress or tension 
headache. These headaches are caused when there is stress to the cervical 
muscles in the neck and scalp muscles. This type of headache is extremely 
common and does not indicate anything serious. The treatment is with over 
the counter analgesics. If the headache worsens even with treatment or 
there is rapid worsening of the headache, a CT of the brain can be done to 
rule out any underlying pathology.
