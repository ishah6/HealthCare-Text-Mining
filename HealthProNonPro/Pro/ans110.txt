Any discharge post surgery could be an indication of infection. Other signs 
that also may indicate an infection include fever, pain, swelling and 
tenderness in the operated area. Your doctor may need to rule out infection 
for which a course of antibiotics may be required. Your symptoms of 
tingling pain during urination may be caused by irritation from the 
catheter use during surgery. If you develop any signs of fever, swelling or 
tenderness in the abdomen, I would suggest that you immediately consult 
your doctor or go to the ER to rule out infection and abscess formation.
