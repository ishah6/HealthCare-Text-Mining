Suggest you cleanse your system, by flushing all the toxins.  Dietry supplements, such as "sustegen" energy drinks.  Your fasting will achieve fullfilment & enlightenment.  Too much coffee will make you nauseated & anxious.  Start eating fruits & nuts when you have the urge to divulge.  Warning signs of starvation: lethargy, tiredness,  lack of natural bodily functions.  Best to let someone supervise your progress for safety reasons.
     Good Luck!
