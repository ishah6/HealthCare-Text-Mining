One thing I dont understand quite is where your breath fits into his impotence problem. If he is unable to maintain an erection, he does have a problem. 
 Sounds to me that you two have some serious issues which may be the cause of his impotence.  Like you saying you want out of relationship, well umm that is not going to turn him on, stalker or not. 
 Also if he is stalking you that does not necessarily mean he is attracted it just means he is obsessed with the range of your relationship..
 I think it is time to move on for the both of you as you both need some growing up to do. 
 Best of luck
