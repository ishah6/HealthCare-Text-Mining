The presence of blood on the wipes could indicate a hemorrhoid or an anal 
fissure. However I doubt that the antibiotic is the cause of the 
hemorrhoids. You may try a hemorrhoidal cream and sitz bath to relieve the 
symptoms. If the symptoms get worse even on treatment, then you may have to 
get it examined by your doctor.
