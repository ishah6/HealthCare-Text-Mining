Thank you for your question. We are lead to believe that this large 
swelling near your umbilicus is probably an umbilical or abdominal hernia. 
A hernia is caused by the protrusion of abdominal contents through a 
weakened area in the abdomen. This can only be treated by surgical 
correction. Should you develop abdominal pain and nausea, vomiting or 
constipation please go to your nearest emergency room as you may have 
developed an intestinal obstruction.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
