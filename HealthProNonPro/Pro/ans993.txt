Possibly the pain is not totally consequence of the EMG, remember that you 
have a radicular nerve compression L5 that may be painful, on the other 
hand, the action of moving the needle through different areas of the muscle 
is a necessary part of the examination, as is the activation of the muscle. 
The amount of discomfort that follows after this action can vary because of 
the kind of needle used, the skill of the Electromyographer and the muscle 
being examined (smaller muscles are often more painful).
