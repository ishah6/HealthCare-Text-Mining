The asymmetry of the back and shoulders bones may be due to several 
causes, for example: scoliosis, lack of posture alignment, scapula alata 
(winging scapula). Unfortunately the pictures that you uploaded had a 
problem and the attach can’t be seen. I suggest that you have an 
evaluation by a spine surgeon or Orthopedic specialist who will order the 
corresponding imaging studies to determine the cause of the asymmetry and 
decide the best treatment option in your case.
