Many cases of palpitation are not serious and everyone may get them once in 
a while. Since your ECG check were ok, this would rule out a rhythm 
disturbance of the heart. Other causes of palpitation could be due to 
anxiety, fear, caffeine, nicotine or anemia. You should practice yoga and 
meditation techniques to ease your stress level. Morning or evening walks 
will also help you relax your mind and body so that you can think clearly 
and increase your concentration. If these do not help, I would suggest you 
to see your doctor for further evaluation. Sometimes elevated levels of 
thyroid hormone may also cause palpitations.
