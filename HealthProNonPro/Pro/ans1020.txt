Rapid heart rate and palpitations can often be due to premature ventricular 
complexes, which are generally benign. However it is important to rule 
heart rhythm abnormalities. I advise attending your family doctor for a 
full history and clinical examination. He can perform an ECG (electrical 
trace of the heart) and may refer you for a 24 hour Holter (heart) monitor. 
He may also refer you to a cardiologist for advice, if any abnormal rhythms 
are recorded. I wish you well, take care.
