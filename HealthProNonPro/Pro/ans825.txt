Lip sores have many causes and it is difficult to determine the cause with 
history alone. My probable diagnosis with what you've mentioned would be a 
viral infection (most probably herpes simplex virus) or a bacterial 
infection.However, since you have been experiencing these breakouts for a period of 9 
months, I would recommend that you see your doctor or dermatologist to rule 
out a more serious underlying pathology such as a weakened immune system, 
dermatitis, autoimmune disease and even cancer.
