eat 4-6 small meals every day instead of 2 or 3 large ones - pay attention to portion sizes when you do this... eat a variety of proteins, carbs, fruits, and veggies, and drink tons of water! Dehydrated fat cells stick together causing them to stick to you! When you drink water, it hydrates the fat cells and makes them separate so they can be flushed out... If you do nothing else in the area of exercise - walk for 30 minutes a day. Even if you have to separate it into time blocks, every step you take is another step you hadnt taken before. 

*If you have a salty-tooth but dont want to eat anything really heavy - try popcorn with limited salt/butter.

*For a sweet-tooth that cant be appeased by fruits, eat cotton candy... even though its pure sugar, you have to eat a TON of it for the calories to really add up :)
