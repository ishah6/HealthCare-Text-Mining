Testosterone pellet implants work by releasing testosterone at a steady 
rate. The duration of action is about 6 months in an uncomplicated cycle. 
The advantages to pellets over other types of testosterone therapy is 
that it's a more convenient method of delivery. Testosterone is delivered 
in a steady manner which keeps levels consistent in your blood and avoids 
erratic swings that may occur with other forms of delivery. Your doctor 
will need to monitor your testosterone levels in order to determine the 
effective dosage and monitor side effects such as unusual hair growth, hair 
loss, anxiety,breast enlargement, infertility, increased sex drive, nausea, 
tingling, fluid retention, headache, prolonged erections, elevated 
cholesterol and prostate enlargement.
