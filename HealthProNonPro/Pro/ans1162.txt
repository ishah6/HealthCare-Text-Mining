Thank you for your question. It is normal for you to experience minor 
bleeding of this laceration after it has been sutured. Your current 
antiseptic protocol is adequate, but we would like you to limit the amount 
of direct contact you have with the wound. Try to wear gloves and use 
sterile gauze when cleaning or applying medications to it and also change 
your dressing on a daily basis. Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
