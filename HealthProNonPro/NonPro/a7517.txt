As far as I know, energy healing is considered an alternative healing method based on the manipulation of the Qi (chi or chee).  Normally a person is surrounded by a field of energy, which is sometimes seen as an Aura of color.  It is an ancient method fromt the Orient that has gained popularity in the recent years. As of yet, there is no scientific proof, but there are a lot of theories on how this works.
