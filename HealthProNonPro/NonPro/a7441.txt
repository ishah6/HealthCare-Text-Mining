Why ant you go to the Doctor?

Treatment is more effective when a partnership develops that includes the patient, family members, and doctor. The doctor will suggest a treatment plan based on the patients age, symptoms, and general health. The patient or family member providing care plays a large role in the success of the treatment plan by carefully following the doctors instructions and paying attention to what is or is not helpful. Most patients will notice improvement with proper skin care and lifestyle changes
