Professionalism means that throughout your working life, you will improve your knowledge, your skills, your wisdom, and your conduct. Think about those four words.

Knowledge is not the same as wisdom. (Anyone with a teenager is probably painfully aware of that.) When you hear about a business scandal, the people involved may have had some of these traits, such as knowledge or skills, but probably not all four aspects. Its the balance of the four, and the way they influence each other, that makes someone a professionalâ€”knowledge and skills, conduct thats tempered by wisdom.
