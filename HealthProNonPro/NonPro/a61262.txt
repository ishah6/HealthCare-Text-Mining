I think when you have everything you have nothing to look forward too. Make some goals and reach them even if there small they still count like maybe not drink and do something else for once. Take a art class maybe, use your mind instead of waste it, you might also know that your wasting yourself being a drunk your doing nothing good for anyone including yourself I would be depressed if I had everything and I did nothing productive ever.
