Though many articles suggest that there is no need to be concerned about 
the pills causing birth defects, I would advise you to discontinue the 
meprate (Medroxyprogesterone) and consult your obstetrician as soon as 
possible. You can do a blood test to detect pregnancy if you are not sure 
if the urine pregnancy test was positive or not.
