Measuring the penis when it isn't erect is pointless, since the length and 
bulk are affected by various temporary factors, such as the ambient 
temperature. However, at normal temperatures a non-erect penis usually 
measures between 8.5cm and 10.5cm (3-4 inches) from tip to base. The 
average figure is about 9.5cm (3.75 inches). If you are concerned about 
your penis length, you may need to consult a urologist. There are special 
extending frame devices that try to stretch the penis. Also 
penile-lengthening surgery can be offered to men with severe shortening due 
to congenital abnormalities.
