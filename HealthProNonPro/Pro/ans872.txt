Milk discharge from the nipple unrelated to pregnancy (Galactorrhea) may be 
a sign of an underlying problem. Excessive breast stimulation, medication 
side effects, or disorders of the pituitary gland all may contribute to 
galactorrhea. Galactorrhea may also results from increased levels of 
prolactin, the hormone that stimulates milk production. Sometimes, there is 
no identifiable cause of galactorrhea and usually subsides on its own.I would advise you to avoid breast stimulation, use breast pads and book an 
appointment with your doctor. A physical examination, analysis of the fluid 
discharge from the nipple, blood thyroid levels, pregnancy tests, an 
ultrasound of the breast or MRI may be needed for further evaluation. 
Treatment will depend on the cause. I wish you well, take care.
