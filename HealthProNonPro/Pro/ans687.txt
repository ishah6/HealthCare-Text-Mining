It is difficult for me to comment whether you could be pregnant or not. 
Usually urine tests done for pregnancy are sensitive 2-3 weeks after 
conception. A blood pregnancy test is more sensitive and will be able to 
determine pregnancy even after 1 week of conception. Stress may also lead 
to a delayed period. Please consult your family physician in order to 
conduct further testing . All the best.
