The symptoms that you have described could be most probably related to the 
antibiotics that you have been taking. I do understand that you are 
concerned about being pregnant and it is but natural. Usually a urine 
pregnancy test confirms pregnancy within two weeks of conception. Since 
your tests have come back negative, there is a less likely chance that you 
may be pregnant, however you may want to repeat the test if you miss your 
periods. Hope the information helps, take care.
