I do understand your concern. Although very rare, fragrances in nature have 
been found to cause exacerbation of symptoms and airway obstruction in 
asthmatic patients, including chest tightening and wheezing. Fragrance has 
be targeted as the most common cause of cosmetic allergic contact 
dermatitis. It is difficult for me to comment whether the episode you 
experienced is due to an anaphylactic attack or an exacerbation of acute 
asthmatic symptoms due to exposure of a particular fragrance, further 
investigation is required. If your symptoms were grave enough, definitely 
an epipen would be helpful in such a case.
