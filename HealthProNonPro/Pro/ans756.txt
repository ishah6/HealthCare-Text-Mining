It is possible that the cause of your eye pain is due to a sinus infection. 
Sometimes these can aggravate and cause preseptal or orbital cellulitis. 
Orbital cellulitis involves infection of the fat and muscle contained in 
the bony orbit. I would suggest that you see your healthcare provider for 
appropriate antibiotic management. Antibiotics may include 
amoxicillin-clavulanate, cefpodoxime or cefdinir.
