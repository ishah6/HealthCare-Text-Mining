It depends on what else accompanies the dizziness so the cause may be 
determined. If you have also vertigo, then usually results from a problem 
with the nerves and the structures of the balance mechanism in your inner 
ear (vestibular system), which sense movement and changes in your head 
position. Sitting up or moving around may make it worse. Some causes of 
vertigo include: benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, inflammation of the 
inner ear; If you feel like fainting or lightheaded without losing 
consciousness, then a possible cause might be a drop in the blood pressure 
or orthostatic hypotension, also consider an inadequate output of blood 
from the heart. Blood pressure lowering medications may cause faintness if 
they lower your blood pressure too much. Many other medications can cause 
nonspecific feelings of dizziness that resolve when you stop the 
medication. Certain anxiety disorders, such as panic attacks and a fear of 
leaving home or being in large, open spaces (agoraphobia), may cause 
dizziness. Sometimes one cause — such as a vestibular disorder — may 
produce symptoms, but then anxiety causes your dizziness to persist even 
after your inner ear problem has resolved.
