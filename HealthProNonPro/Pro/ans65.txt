According to your description, your father may be experiencing a cervical 
nerve compression that is producing the neck pain and the numbness in the 
arm. . In the younger patients, cervical radiculopathy may be a result of a 
disc herniation or an acute injury causing impingement at the level where 
the nerve is leaving the spine. In the older patient, cervical 
radiculopathy is often a result of spinal canal narrowing from bone 
(osteophyte) formation, decreased disc height and degenerative changes due 
to aging process. The treatment strategy usually includes: start a physical 
therapy program aimed to control pain and inflammation, and the use of 
anti-inflammatory medication (“motrin”, “aleve”), also re-education of 
habits and posture to improve quality of life. Your father also should be 
independent in a stretching and strengthening program and continue with 
these exercises under the periodic supervision of a physical therapist 
initially and then completely on his own. If his condition fails to 
improve with a comprehensive rehabilitation program and selective 
injections, He may be considering a re-evaluation by a Orthopedic surgeon 
to explore other treatment options more aggressive.
