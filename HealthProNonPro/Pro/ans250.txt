Due to the presence of risk factors as from your sexual history and the 
uncertainty of HIV, I would advise you to get tested for HIV. In majority 
of the cases the antibodies for HIV develop within6 weeks to 3 months after 
infection. The HIV antibody test looks for antibodies to the virus in a 
person's blood. If you are waiting to take an HIV antibody test, it is 
vital that you do not put yourself at risk through further exposures to HIV 
during this time period. This means you should practise safe sex and not 
share needles.
