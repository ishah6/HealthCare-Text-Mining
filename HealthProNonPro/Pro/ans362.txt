Hepatitis B virus can definitely be transmitted between family members 
within households, possibly by contact of mucous membrane with secretions 
or saliva containing the virus. The main mode of transmission of the virus 
is through blood and blood products, unsterile needles, unprotected sex and 
from an infected mother to her child during delivery. I would suggest that 
you and members of the family consult your doctor for Hepatitis B 
vaccination.
