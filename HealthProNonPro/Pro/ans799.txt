It may be embarrassing to tell your doctor problems about the genitals. 
Problems with the foreskin is quite common and difficulty in retracting the 
foreskin could be the result of phimosis, chronic infection of the skin 
sheath due to posthitis and balanitis and inflammation due to forced 
retraction and irritants such as a soaps and creams.You have also mentioned about a stinging pain that you experience after 
urinating. This may not be related to the foreskin problem and may be the 
result of a urinary tract infection. In my opinion, the next step in the 
management would be a physical examination and a urinalysis.Treatment will depend on the cause. The non surgical treatment of phimosis 
includes topical steroid creams and manual stretching of the foreskin. 
Surgical methods consists of circumcision, slitting of the foreskin and 
preputioplasty. You may have to consult with your doctor for proper 
diagnosis and treatment, take care.
