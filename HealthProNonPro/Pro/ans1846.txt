Your symptoms may be caused due to a musculo-skeletal strain. I would 
advise you to take OTC pain-killers/NSAIDS and see if it helps. Rest and 
ice will also help to relieve the symptoms. If the pain does not get 
better, you may need to visit your doctor for a physical examination. 
X-rays will usually be normal in most cases.
