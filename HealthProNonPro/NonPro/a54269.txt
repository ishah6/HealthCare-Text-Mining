I cannot imagine that anyone can pull that over outside a clinical setting with medical supervision. Why not consider a more realistic, achievable goal? You didnt pack it on in a month, Im sure.
A friend of mine lost 50 pounds in 4 months. He went to the gym twice a day (2 hrs/day) at lunch time and after work, did aerobics and weights and changed his eating habits.
