You may be having bacterial vaginosis (vulvovaginitis). This is a caused 
when there is an overgrowth of normally residing flora (bacteria and/or 
fungi) on the vagina. Vulvovaginitis presents with vaginal discharge, 
irritation, and itching.I would suggest you to consult your primary care physician to rule out the 
exact pathogen that is causing your vaginosis and prescribe the right 
treatment for it. In the majority of cases, this type of infections are 
caused by Fungus or bacteria that are part of your normal flora and 
sometimes due to factors that change or alter the PH of your vagina such as 
Douching, applying deodorants and cause overgrowth of this entities. I wish 
you a prompt recovery.
