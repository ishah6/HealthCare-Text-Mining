It is difficult to say the reason for your weight gain as there are so many 
aspects to it. Certain possibilities could be due to increased muscles mass 
after exercise. Also there is a possibility for weight gain during the 
early stages , because as your level of activity increases, so does your 
appetite. I would suggest that you increase intake of complex carbohydrates 
and food with low glycemic index. Conntinue with your exercise and your 
will see results soon. I wish you well, take care.
