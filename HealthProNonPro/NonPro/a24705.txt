Ah..I can relate to that completely. I feel the same way everyday..What I am doing to try and make it stop is looking deep inside of myself..Try to look into yourself and see if you can pinpoint, or at least get a general idea of what is making you sad. When you know whats wrong, you can begin to think about what to do next and what your next step should be. It takes time, but it is worth the patience and time. You will begin to feel much better over time, really..Most people would tell you to find God, or adopt a religion of some kind. While maybe that !!MIGHT!! be a soulution for you, it isnt always so. If you cant find inner peace by yourself and for yourself, then I dont see how a God could do it really, or even help you any at that..That is just my opinion though..If you cant really tell what it making you think way, and it has just inexplicably came really out of nowhere or something, try taking vitamins or something. A lack of any kind of vitamin can sometimes throw things off in the body. Or another option is to go to a counselor or something like that. Having someone to talk to really does help things along..If all else fails, go to a psychiatrist or your doctor and get on some meds..This is my last suggestion that I wouldent have anyone take because meds sometimes have no effect, or they alter your mind completely and make you worse than you previously were before the medication. Only use medication in the worst case scenario..
