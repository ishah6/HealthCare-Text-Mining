Oh, my -- please ignore the answer that says you should be around 85. Yes, there are some women who are naturally very tiny-boned and weigh in their 80s or 90s when they are 52", but a general VERY ROUGH guideline is that a woman (which you would be, physically, at age 16) who is 5 feet weighs 100 pounds. Then, for every inch thereafter, add on five pounds. So the "guideline weight" for you at 52" would be 110.

HOWEVER, please take that with a grain of salt. Thats only a rough guideline without taking into account how muscular you are, your bone structure, or any of those factors. You really should not go by weight -- its a meaningless number. Concentrating on health and fitness will get you both an ideal weight and a great appearance. If you must go by a numerical measure, you might want to measure your body mass index instead. Its much more telling than just your weight. The link below connects you to a BMI calculator.
