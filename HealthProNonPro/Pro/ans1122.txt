Thank you for your question. Although petroleum gel is a relatively inert 
substance, and is hypoallergenic. It can become contaminated with bacteria 
and when applied to the lips or sensitive areas, it can irritate the the 
skin. You may need to have your lips examined by a doctor and be prescribed 
a topical corticosteroid cream to treat this inflammation. Please see your 
doctor.
