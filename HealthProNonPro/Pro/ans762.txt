It is possible that your headaches are caused due to flaring up of the 
sinusitis. Often sinusitis can present as a one-sided headache. If 
treatment with over the counter medication and nasal spray with saline does 
not help, consider consulting an ENT specialist for further evaluation. 
There is a chance that there may be a collection of mucus in the sinuses 
which may have to be removed for you to feel better.
