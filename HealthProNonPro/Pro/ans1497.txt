The symptoms that you described, most likely may be associated to an excess 
of repetitive activities that may be over stressing your hands and arm. You 
may try anti-inflammatory medication if you feel any pain and see how it 
goes. If you notice that the pain and discomfort become more frequent and 
there are associated other symptoms as tingling, numbness, and then a 
Carpal tunnel syndrome must be ruled out.
