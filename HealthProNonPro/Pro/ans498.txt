I do understand your concern. I would definitely advise taking Plan B if 
you want to avoid getting pregnant. Plan B is most effective if taken as 
soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours of having unprotected sex. 
However, it works well up to 72 hours and might even be effective if taken 
within 120 hours (five days).
