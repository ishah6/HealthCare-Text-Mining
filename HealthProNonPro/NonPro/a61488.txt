Initial reaction is that your man is a baby. He needs to grow up and stop drinking so much. My man understands that alcohol and hard ons can be a tough combination and sometimes we just let it go until morning and then go again when everyones a bit more sober. However, hes almost 30. I think its great that youre willing to make him happy, no matter what, but the way hes yelling and complaining and making things your fault, is totally unhealthy. Do you ever b*tch at him for the fact that youre not getting off either? 
I say ditch the guy entirely and find yourself someone who wants to make YOU happy! :)
