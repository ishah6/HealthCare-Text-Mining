Nervous fatigue or neurasthenia is a psychological disorder characterized 
by chronic fatigue and weakness, loss of memory, and generalized aches and 
pains, formerly thought to result from exhaustion of the nervous system. 
Neurasthenia is a complex phenomenon involving the central nervous system 
(CNS) and muscle. It is though that increase in the levels of 5-HT, 
serotonin and cytokines may bring about the disorder. Though there may be 
no definite therapy, a balanced diet, moderate exercise, and muscle and 
stress relaxation techniques like meditation may help.
