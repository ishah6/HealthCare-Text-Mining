Bleeding during pregnancy may be a sign of a possible miscarriage. Most 
miscarriages occur before the 12th week of pregnancy. Though bleeding is 
sometimes seen with pregnancy, it is not common for the bleeding to 
continue for a period of 5 days. I would suggest first to consult your 
Gynecologist to rule out miscarriage. Your doctor may repeat the beta HCG 
test to see if the levels are rising. A decrease in the level of beta HCG 
may require an ultrasound to rule out a miscarriage.
