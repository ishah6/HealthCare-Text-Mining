High blood pressure in a young adult could be indicative of an underlying 
renal pathology such as glomerulonephritis or renal artery disease. Obesity 
and thyroid disease could also cause an increase in the blood pressure. You 
may need to consult your doctor for further tests and analysis to determine 
the cause of your high blood pressure. In the meantime, lifestyle 
modifications like healthy diet, exercise and restriction of salt may help 
in reducing blood pressure.
