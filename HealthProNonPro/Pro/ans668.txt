Isotretinoin is contraindicated during pregnancy. Females of childbearing 
potential should not become pregnant during therapy or for 1 month 
following discontinuation of isotretinoin. Major fetal abnormalities (both 
internal and external), spontaneous abortion, premature births and low IQ 
scores in surviving infants have been reported. It is difficult for me to 
tell you how big is the risk. I would recommend following up with your 
doctor. A special ultrasound done in the second trimester of pregnancy may 
be able to see if a birth defect has been caused by exposure to 
isotretinoin. Ultrasound can detect many birth defects but it cannot tell 
if a child may have learning or developmental problems.
