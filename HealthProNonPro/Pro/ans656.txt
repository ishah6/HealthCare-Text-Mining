Infectious mononucleosis is characterized by a triad of fever, tonsillar 
pharyngitis, and lymphadenopathy. The infection is caused by the 
Epstein-Barr virus and is spread through saliva. The vast majority of 
individuals with primary EBV infection recover uneventfully and develop 
long term immunity to the virus. Most acute symptoms resolve in one to two 
weeks, although fatigue and poor functional status can persist for months. 
The reason why some patients do not return to prior health is unclear and 
unfortunately not much can be done. I would advise that you take a health 
diet and refrain from strenuous physical activity until fully recovered.
