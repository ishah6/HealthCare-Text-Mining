I do understand your concern, but would like to assure you that most 
irregular periods are benign. It is most probable that the OPC would have 
resulted in your irregular period. Sometimes in the first 2 to 3 months 
after women start taking contraceptives pills, irregular menstruation might 
be irregular. However if the bleeding continues or the periods are still 
irregular after 2-3 months, I would advise you to consult with your doctor.
