Chronic cough that is present for more than 8 weeks and is a challenge for 
a physician to diagnose and treat. Your doctor may investigate you for the 
presence of asthma, cigarette smoking, reflux disease, sinus problems and 
infections like bronchitis and pneumonia. Certain medications like ACE 
Inhibitors used in treating hypertension can also cause cough. The 
treatment of chronic cough is directed towards finding the cause of the 
cough and treating it. Over the counter drugs containing dextromethorphan 
(a cough suppressant), steam inhalation, cough lozenges and drinking lots 
of water will bring symptomatic relief.
