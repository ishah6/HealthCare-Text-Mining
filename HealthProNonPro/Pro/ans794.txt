It is very likely that the beta-blocker (bissoprolol) that you are taking 
is preventing the increase in heart rate during an exercise. Patients on 
beta blockers are not able to reach their desired target heart rate even 
after exercising at a proper intensity level. However, this does not mean 
that your exercise is ineffective and that you are not benefiting from the 
exercise.I would advise that you consult your doctor. An excercise stress test can 
be done to check the flow of blood through the heart during an exercise. 
This will help to determine what your appropriate target heart rate should 
be. You can also try monitoring your resting heart rate and then try to 
target a heart rate 20-30 beats per minute higher than the resting rate.
