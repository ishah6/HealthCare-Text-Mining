Chicken pox is a highly contagious disease caused by varicella zoster 
virus. Once you have acquired chicken pox, the body develops immunity 
against the infection. Your immunity cannot be transferred to your child 
and varicella vaccination will ensure the development of immunity against 
chicken pox in your child.
