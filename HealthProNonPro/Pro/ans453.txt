I do understand your concern for your child's health. It is expected that 
all newborns will lose some weight in the first 5-7 days of life. There is 
a 7-10% loss in weight in a breast fed baby. Most babies should be back at 
birth weight by 10-14 days of life but may take a little longer if the 
child is sick or is born premature. I would not be too concerned at this time, and would advice you to monitor 
your child's weight. If you find that your child is not feeding well and 
there is significant weight loss, you may need to consult your child's 
pediatrician then.
