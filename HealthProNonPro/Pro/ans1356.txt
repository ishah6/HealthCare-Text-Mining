The heel pain that you described might has been produced by a acute injury 
of the plantar fascia: plantar fasciitis, during your training; on the 
other hand and according to your description of the swelling of the 
Achilles, you might have had a Achilles Tendonitis, which is an 
inflammation of the heel tendon, usually resulting from overuse associated 
with a change in playing surface, footwear, extreme stretching or intensity 
of an activity. Sometimes called the heel cord, it is the largest tendon in 
the human body. When the calf muscles contract, the Achilles tendon is 
tightened, pulling the heel. This allows you to point your foot and stand 
on tiptoe. Certain illnesses (such as arthritis and diabetes) and 
medications (such as corticosteroids and some antibiotics) can also 
increase the risk of rupture. Injury can happen in these situations: You 
make a forceful push-off with your foot while your knee is straightened by 
the powerful thigh muscles. You suddenly trip or stumble, and your foot is 
thrust in front to break a fall, forcefully overstretching the tendon or as 
in your case a forceful stretching of the calf muscles. Treatment must 
reflect a balance between protection and early motion: Protection is 
necessary to allow time for healing and to prevent re injury. Moving your 
foot and ankle is needed to prevent stiffness and loss of muscle tone.
