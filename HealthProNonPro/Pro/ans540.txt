I do understand your problem of painful periods. Painful menstruation, also 
known as dysmenorrhea, is one of the most common gynecologic problems. Most 
women begin having dysmenorrhea during adolescence, usually within four to 
five years of the first menstrual period. Painful periods become less 
common as women age. The pain is causes by prostaglandins which cause 
muscle contractions in the uterus, decrease blood flow and oxygen to the 
uterus.This primary management of dysmenorrhea are Non-steroidal antiinflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) and birth control pills. There are also certain 
non-pharmacological treatments that you can try :i) Applying heat to the lower abdomen with a heating pad, hot water bottle, 
or self-heating patch can significantly reduce pain.ii) Exercise seems to reduce menstrual symptoms, including pain, in some 
studies.iii) Healthy diet.iv) There is some evidence that complementary medicine practices such as 
yoga or acupuncture are effective in reducing painful periods.v) Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a treatment that 
involves the use of electrode patches, which are applied to the skin near 
the area of pain. TENS has been used to treat pain caused by many 
conditions, and may help to reduce dysmenorrhea in some women.If neither NSAIDs nor a hormonal birth control treatment adequately improve 
pain, the next step would depend upon the woman's age, symptoms, and other 
medical conditions. I would recommend that you speak to your doctor if 
symptoms do not improve. Diagnostic laparoscopy may be recommended to 
determine if endometriosis, or another condition, could be causing the pain.
