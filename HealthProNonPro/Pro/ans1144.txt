Thank you for your question. Hand sanitizer contains isopropanol or ethanol 
among other chemical agents and is meant for external use only. If it comes 
in contact with the sensitive tissue of the vaginal canal it can cause 
irritation, which can lead to inflammation, bleeding and infection. It is 
possible that your symptoms are due to this. We strongly recommend that you 
seek medical attention immediately and have a pelvic exam to determine if 
you have developed an infection or a severe chemical irritation of your 
vaginal canal. Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
