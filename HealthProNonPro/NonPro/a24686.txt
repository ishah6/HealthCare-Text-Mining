You should try Yoga if you havent done that already.To be more precise, you should try out Patanjali Yoga as taught by Swami Ramdev of India.He has started a self-healing Yoga revolution all over the world.In India alone 4 crore people have regained good health by eradicating the most stubborn and chronic diseases.I too have benefitted first hand from this.My chronic lower back problem which had thrown my life into complete disarray since the last 7 years is almost gone.Apart from this you could also try Kriya Yoga as taught by Sri Sri Ravi Shankar or Kundalini Yoga as taught by the followers of Sri Harbhajan Singh Yogiji.Trust me,any of this will help you a lot if you give it your best shot.Let me know if you need any further help.
