It is difficult to say what could be the cause of your symptoms without a 
physical examination. An underlying yeast infection and stress could 
definitely cause your periods to become irregular. I would not rush into a 
diagnostic conclusion as of yet. As long as you are not feeling ill and not 
associated symptoms like itching or soreness, observation is advised. If it 
continues throughout the period or persists for more than one cycle, it 
would be a good idea to have it investigated. I hope this answers your 
question, take care.
