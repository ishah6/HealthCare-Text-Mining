The syndrome of transient headache and neurologic deficits with 
cerebrospinal fluid lymphocytosis (HaNDL) is a self-limited, benign entity. 
Though MS is not related, it can be confused with HaNDL, particularly when 
the first episode of multiple sclerosis manifests as focal neurologic 
symptoms and signs together with headache. Electrophoresis usually help 
with the diagnosis.
