I do understand your concern. Your diarrhea is most probably viral in 
origin and should subside in a day or two. If your diarrhea does not stop 
or reduce in frequency in 2 days, you should see a doctor for treatment and 
get a stool and blood test done. At this time, it is important for you to 
rehydrate yourself to replace the fluids lost from the body.
