Since your tests are showing mixed results, I would advise that you wait 
for 2 weeks before doing another pregnancy test. Sometimes the pregnancy 
hormones do not reach a sufficient level to be detected in the tests. You 
can ask your doctor for a quantitative hCG test to confirm pregnancy. I 
hope this helps, take care.
