Drooling may be normal in infants, especially when they are teething. 
Children can usually control drooling by 4 years of age. If the drooling is 
excessive and causing concern, you may need to talk to your child's 
pediatrician to rule out any problem with your child's swallowing and mouth 
and tongue control. After an initial assessment, your child’s doctor may 
have your child assessed by a group of health providers These include a 
speech and language therapist, physiotherapist, orthodontist, orthotist, 
and otolaryngologist (ear, nose, and throat specialist).
