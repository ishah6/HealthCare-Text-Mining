I am one of those guys that looses his mind around a girl with large breast (unfortunately). I get stupid and I am sure I am also rude.  

I try very, very hard to fight this, but it is a huge weakness.

My point is that you can either:
1.  Learn to enjoy this power you have over men.
2.  Learn to minimize the appearance of size.
3.  Get a reduction.

I have a female friend for each of these techniques, and each is happy with her decision.

btw, I have one more request
Please try to forgive the "good guys" who are WAY to attracted to big breast.
