Thank you for your question. Cerebral atrophy may be a normal finding as 
one gets older, or may be related to a neurodegenerative condition such as 
Alzheimer's disease. Given this initial finding, it is important that you 
promptly follow up with a neurologist in order to make sure that this mild 
cerebral atrophy is not due to a serious neurodegenerative disease.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
