Well i would say just do at least 20 push-ups about 3 times a day and 100 sit-ups for four weeks you might see results. I see results but i weigh 110 and Im 13 now i got a  eight pack. I used some stuff called muscle milk it is powder that you mix with milk or water ( that you drink ) That taste like ice cream but if you drink it ( YOU REALLY HAVE ) to do push ups and sit ups it works but if you dont workout it will sit there and turn into fat. What it is is it has protein, and alot of nutrients you need. Good Luck
