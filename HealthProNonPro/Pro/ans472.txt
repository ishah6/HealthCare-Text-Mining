I do understand your concern, chronic or non-bacterial prostatitis is a 
difficult entity to treat. Chronic nonbacterial prostatitis may cause 
long-term pain and urinary symptoms. The possible causes of chronic 
prostatitis are infection by bacteria, fungi, viruses, irritation caused by 
the backflow of unine into the bladder and urethral strictures.Treatment involves trial of antibiotics like trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, 
levofloxacin or ciprofloxacin. Bladder neck dysfunction may be treated with 
alpha-blockers such as terazosin or doxazocin. A urethral stricture can be 
surgically repaired. Some patients have had improvement of prostatitis 
symptoms after transurethral microwave thermotherapy (TUMT).Avoiding food that might cause irritation like alcohol, lemon, carbonated 
drinks, spicy food, coffee, acidic food and chocolate may help reduce the 
urinary irritation symptoms. frequent ejaculations may also help to improve 
the symptoms by allowing the natural drainage of secretions from the 
prostate. If symptoms do not resolve, I would advise periodic reevaluation 
by your urologist.
