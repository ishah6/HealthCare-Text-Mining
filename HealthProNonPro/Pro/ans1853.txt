Your symptoms of discomfort in the sternum area may be caused by a number 
of conditions. Inflammation of the digestive organs, such as gastritis and 
pancreatitis, gallstones, reflux disease, chest infection, heart attack or 
angina may all present with upper abdominal pain.If the burning pain has not resolved with proton pump inhibition (Nexium) 
treatment. I advise attending your family doctor or gastroenterologist for 
a detailed history of the pain and a clinical examination.
