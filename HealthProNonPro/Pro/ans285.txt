Exhaustion and reduced drive may be present in menopause, depression and 
chronic fatigue syndrome. You will have to consult your GP in this regard. 
Usually most of the tests will come back normal, so a detailed history and 
a thorough physical examination may reveal the diagnosis. The treatment 
will depend on the diagnosis. A family physicain who can see you in the 
long term is the doctor that I would choose. Hope this answers your 
questions, take care.
