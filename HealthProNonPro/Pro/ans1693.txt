Vaginal itching may be caused by yeast infection, chemical irritants and 
vulvovaginitis. Reviewing the symptoms you've mentioned, you are most 
probably suffering from vulvovaginitis. This is a very common occurrence in 
adolescent females and is caused by bacteria, viruses, yeasts, parasites 
and sexually transmitted infections. It is important for you to see your 
doctor for an examination and microscopical analysis or culture of the 
discharge. Treatment depends on the cause of the itching and may include 
antibiotics, anti-fungal creams or antihistamines. At this time it is 
important for you to avoid perfumed or bubble baths, sprays and douches 
also keep the area dry and wear cotton underwear.
