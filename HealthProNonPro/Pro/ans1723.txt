What you may be experiencing are ectopic heartbeats. These are small 
variations in an otherwise normal heartbeat that causes an irregular pulse. 
They may occur without an obvious cause and are usually harmless. Though 
these ectopic beats may also be present with persons having an underlying 
heart disease. Ectopic beats are made worse with alcohol. coffee, certain 
drugs and smoking. If these irregular beats occur frequently, I would 
suggest that you consult your doctor for a complete physical examination 
with and elctrocardiogram and echocardiogram if necessary.
