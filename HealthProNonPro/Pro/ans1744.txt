With your previous history of spine surgery (Harrington’s rods) you should 
be very careful when lifting heavy objects. Most likely after the lifting 
effort that you described, you are experiencing a Mechanical low back pain 
(LBP), which is the second most common reason for seeing a physician in the 
United States. Of the US population, 85% will experience an episode of 
mechanical LBP at some point during their lifetime. Fortunately, the LBP 
resolves for the vast majority within 2-4 weeks. Sometimes it may 
complicate with a sciatic nerve inflammation, in that case it will take 
longer to get better. The suggested strategy would be: a physical therapy 
program aimed to: if you are overweight, then keep your weight under 
control, because the overweight suppose additional stress to the lumbar 
spine, control the pain and the local inflammatory process, relative rest, 
flexion and extension exercises of the spine to reduce the nerve and muscle 
tension, exercises that improve the muscular strength and endurance of 
lumbar muscles. You can keep taking anti-inflammatory medication (“Motrin”, 
“Aleve”) and you can follow these general recommendations: sleeping with a 
pillow between the knees while lying on one side may increase comfort, 
lying on your back with a pillow under your knees. If the pain persists for 
more than 2 months, it is strongly recommended that you get an evaluation 
by a physician.
