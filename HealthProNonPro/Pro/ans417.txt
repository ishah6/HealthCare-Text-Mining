I do understand that your symptoms are aggravated during times to stress. 
What you have describe to me suggest that you may be suffering from what is 
known as transient motor tics. What brings about these movements is not 
known but some believe there may be a genetic aspect to the abnormal 
movements. Usually these movements tend to resolve on their own and may not 
need treatment. If you feel that these movements are interfering with your 
daily activities then I suggest you visit you family doctor for further 
investigation. Your doctor may order necessary tests (EEG and MRI) to rule 
out other disorders such as seizures. The treatment for tic disorders 
depends on the severity of the condition. In many instances, no treatment 
is needed and the tics will resolve on their own. Doctors may prescribe 
behavioral therapy, medication, or a combination of the two. Behavioral 
therapy helps people learn to manage their tic symptoms and reduce tic 
frequency. Medications are typically used to reduce tic frequency and 
enhance a patient's daily life.
