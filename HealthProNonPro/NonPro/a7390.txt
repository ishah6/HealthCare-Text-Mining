I think that much of medicine is trial-and-error, and not nearly the "scientific" practice it claims to be.  I think Americans are brainwashed by pharmaceutical powerhouses that pump immense amounts of money into producing TV commercials where purple pills fall from the sky and everythings okay.  I think people watch too much TV and are too damn gullible.  I dont think people know the HALF of whats in the various things that may be sitting on the shelves of their medicine cabinets.  Keep in mind that only 15% of all medical interventions are subject to even ONE scientific study.  The rest?  Custom and preference, and if the pharmaceutical rep is cute enough and gives you tickets to a basketball game in exchange for prescribing HER companys drugs, bribery.
