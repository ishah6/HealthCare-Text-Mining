I suggest taking a childbirth class outside of the hospital, find someone with a philosophy that you find comforting and informative. I will put some links in the source section for you (I do this for a living ;)). Also, I would HIGHLY suggest finding a doula, she can help you understand what is happening with your body and how to cope with the sensations, as well as support your partner in taking care of you as well, help keep him calm, etc. If money is an issue, you can often find doulas who will work for free or trade so please dont be afraid to ask. I dont know where you live but I will post some general link to hopefully help you get started.
