Thank you for your question. Sexual thoughts of any kinda are very common 
in teenagers. This is something you should not be concerned with. If these 
thoughts distract you to the point that you are unable to carry out your 
day to day activities then we recommend that you consider speaking to your 
school guidance councilor, or doctor to assist you with controlling these 
thoughts.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
