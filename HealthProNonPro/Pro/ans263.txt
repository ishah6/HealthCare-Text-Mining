Emergency contraceptive pills have no long-term or serious side effects. 
There are no safety concerns about using progestin only emergency 
contraceptive pills (like Plan B) more than once. However, the pills should 
not be used more than once in the same cycle, because there have been no 
studies of repeated use. The pills might also cause your next period to 
come early or late. If you find yourself using emergency contraceptive 
pills a lot, talk to your health care provider for an alternative.
