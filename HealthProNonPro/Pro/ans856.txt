Melanocytes are cells responsible for skin color. An excess of the cells 
may lead to darkening of the skin. You may need to consult a dermatologist 
to rule out other causes of darkening of skin including Addison`s disease, 
lupus, hematochomatosis and rosacea. In the meanwhile you can use a high 
SPF cream when exposed to sun.
