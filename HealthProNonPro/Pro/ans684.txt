It is difficult for any doctor to tell how long it will take for your liver 
cells to heal from injury due to alcohol and for the enzymes to return to a 
normal level. It also depends on how long you have been drinking alcohol 
and the amount of alcohol. Milk thistle and other liver cleanse products 
will not hasten the recovery of your liver. Stopping alcohol is the best 
thing to do.
