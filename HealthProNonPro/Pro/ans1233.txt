Thank you for your question. The progression of your illness requires a 
longer recovery period and you may need to continue with your current 
treatment regimen. What we can suggest is that if your pain becomes more 
severe, you may benefit from a stronger oral analgesic medication. However, 
all remaining equal we recommend that you follow your doctor's 
recommendations accordingly, and if any symptoms become worse please follow 
up with them as soon as possible.AskTheDoctor.com wishes you a rapid recovery.
