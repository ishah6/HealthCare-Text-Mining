I do understand your concern that methylprednisolone may effect your baby. 
I want to assure you that corticosteriods (methylprednisolone) have no 
teratogenic effects. Clinical studies have shown no abnormalities in babies 
whose mothers have taken methylprednisolone. Although methylprednisolone 
use during pregnancy may in rare cases cause premature rupture of membranes 
and low weight babies.If you have no other underlying problems, you do not need to wait to try to 
conceive. I wish you well, take care.
