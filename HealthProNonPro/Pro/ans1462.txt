The reasons for delayed period could be i) Stress ii) illness like fever, 
cough, cold etc. iii) change in work scheduled which alter the rhythm of 
the body iv) hormonal imbalance v) vigorous exercise and vi) thyroid 
disease. Since you have not had your periods for 7 weeks, and pregnancy 
tests are negative, I would advise you to consult your doctor for complete 
physical examination and investigations which include complete blood count, 
thyroid and liver function tests, testosterone levels and ultrasound 
abdomen.
