Dyspareunia is genital pain experienced just before, during or after sexual 
intercourse. Although this condition has historically been classified as a 
psychological sexual disorder, further investigation may be need to rule 
out any underlying structural cause of the pain. I would suggest that you 
visit your doctor/obstetrician for an internal examination and imaging 
studies. The treatment you can try at home are : speak to your partner 
about your concerns, make foreplay last longer, use a lubricating gel and 
perform relaxation/kegal exercises.
