The headaches you are experiencing may be due to exercise headaches that 
occur during or after sustained, strenuous exercise. Some activities like 
running, swimming and weightlifting cause an increased incidence in the 
appearance of these headaches. Usually these headaches are harmless may be 
relieved with medication. However if your headaches last more than a few 
hours, you have sudden and severe headaches, or have vomiting, nausea or 
vision disturbances, I would suggest that you see your doctor for further 
evaluation to rule out underlying problems such as intracranial bleeding, 
abnormality in the blood vessels, sinus or intracranial infection. A CT or 
MRI may help in these cases. If no underlying structural or vascular 
problem is causing your exercise headaches, your doctor may recommend 
medications to help prevent the headaches such as propranolol or 
indomethacin.
