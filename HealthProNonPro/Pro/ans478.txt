I do understand your concern, since your symptoms of fatigue are acute, I 
would most probably say that they are caused due to your exposure to a 
stressful environment. There is no treatment required here. The only 
management you can do is avoid stress, do mild exercises and get proper 
sleep.However if the symptoms of fatigue continue for a long time then this needs 
to be investigated. Chronic fatigue could be caused by an underlying 
diseases such as hypothyroidism, anemia, infections, cardiac conditions, 
medications and depression.
