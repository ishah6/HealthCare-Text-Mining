Both your SGOT and SGPT levels are mildly elevated. Liver function tests 
can be elevated for many different reasons including inflammation or damage 
to the liver, due to infection, disease, toxins or drugs including alcohol. 
They can also be raised secondary to biliary tract disease, such as 
gallstones, which prevent the normal flow of bile from the gallbladder and 
may create a back-pressure effect to the liver. Liver function tests can be 
deranged due to fatty liver, which may also be linked with diabetes.I would advise you to consult with your doctor, usually an ultrasound is 
sufficient to rule out a serious pathology of the liver. In the meanwhile 
you can improve your liver function by limiting the intake of fatty food 
and avoiding alcohol. Take care.
