While Im sure most co-workers would be embarassed to be told their their bad hygiene has gotten to the point where co-workers notice it, I think most people would rather suffer the undirected embarassment than never realize that people are treating them differently because of their hygiene.

I assume that the issues are things that affect other people, as opposed to their hair looking very unkempt?  Even if they end up not being interested in your advice, I think your co-workers will be better off anyway if you take the risk.  While an anonymous note leaves open the possibility that it "could be anyone", I think most people would feel more uncomfortable knowing exactly who informed them about their hygiene.

Here are some articles on this issue:
