If you experience spot bleeding before your period or in the middle of your 
cycle, there’s no reason to be overly worried. A little bit of bleeding 
between menstrual periods or occasional spotting is fairly normal. About 10 
percent of menstruating women regularly spot at the time of ovulation due 
to a temporary drop in estrogen at the time the ovary releases an egg. 
Sometimes stress can cause the brain to not initiate the cycle. This may 
result in spotting in the first half of the cycle. If the ovulation is 
incomplete or skipped, then not enough progesterone is made and spotting 
may occur in the second half of the cycle and could result in spotting 
before your period.
