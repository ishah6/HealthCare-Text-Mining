According to the American Lung Association, nonsmokers exposed to second hand smoke were 25 percent more likely to have coronary heart diseases compared to nonsmokers not exposed to smoke. Your parents are hurting you just as much as if you picked up a cigarette yourself.  Its very wise of you to want to seperate yourself from the dangers of second hand smoke.  I think the best thing you can do is go to this website: http://www.lungusa.org/site/pp.asp?c=dvLUK9O0E&b=35422 and find out all you can about the subject.  And then (make some print offs of the material) sit your parents down for a serious talk. Good Luck to you.
