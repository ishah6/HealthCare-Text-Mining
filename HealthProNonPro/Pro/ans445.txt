I do understand your concern for raised DHEA level in your son. DHEA levels 
begins to rise af seven years of age and starts to decline after the 30s. 
Though unusual, natural DHEA overproduction in children is possible. Excess 
DHEA may present with signs such as growth of pubic hair at a younger age 
than normal. Increased DHEA may also be due to adrenal hyperplasia and 
adrenal tumors. Increased DHEA levels should be closely evaluated by your 
physician and possibly a specialist, such as an endocrinologist, to further 
examine the causes in your son`s particular case.
