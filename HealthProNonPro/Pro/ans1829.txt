Your shoulder pain could be caused by an impinged nerve or tendon, rotator 
cuff injury or due to the mild scoliosis. If rest, ice, and painkillers 
don't help you feel better, I would advise further investigations by your 
doctor. Physical examination and x-rays/CT scan may be helpful in the 
diagnosis of the shoulder pain. Treatment options depend on the cause with 
physical therapy, medication and rest being the primary therapy and joint 
injections and surgery reserved for more severe cases.
