I get UTIs all the time, in fact they run in my family.  Women get them so much more than men because our urethras are shorter, so bacteria is much more likely to be able to make its way up into the bladder.  If you let a bladder infection go to long, it can end up in your kidneys, which is extremely painful and can cause scar tissue.  Although there are no proven reasons as to why you get it, several theories include a welcoming PH level for bacteria to prosper, not wearing cotton panties, not using white toilet paper, and of course not drinking enough water.  Cranberry juice is really good to drink for UTIs because it alters the PH, thereby creating a hostile environment.  Also eating yogurt is good, because the enzymes are helpful in fighting bacteria too.  Not to be too graphic, but always wipe front to back, urinate after sexual activity, and drink that water!!
