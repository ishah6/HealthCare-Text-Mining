It doesnt hurt one bit to get them put on--its when the orthodontist tightens them and a few hours later your mouth/teeth are really sore--but your teeth are moving to get straight, thats why it hurts :)  Its totally worth it. I had braces and I get compliments on my smile all the time.  I did have two teeth pulled and they numb your mouth, so it doesnt hurt when they get pulled.  Trust me on this one--a Smile can actually make someones day better, especially a bright, clean, straight teeth Smile!! : (+)
