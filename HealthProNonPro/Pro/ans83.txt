After sleeping for several hours in a bad position, may be you compromised 
the blood flow to your Rotator Cuff tendon in the shoulder and as a result 
you now have a acute tendinitis. The rotator cuff is a group of tendons 
that support the shoulder. These tendons can be injured during weight 
lifting, when playing sports with a lot of throwing, during sleeping in an 
inadequate position, after repetitive use over a long time or suffer 
degenerative changes with the aging process. Typically, the pain worsens at 
night, a dull ache in the upper outer arm and shoulder, it results from 
mechanical impingement of the rotator cuff tendon beneath the 
anteroinferior portion of the acromion (one of the bones of the shoulder 
joint), causing changes in the distal part of the rotator cuff tendon, 
which is at risk due to poor blood supply. Conservative treatment of the 
Rotator Cuff tendonitis involves: physical therapy to control pain and keep 
range of motion of the shoulder, avoidance of painful movements and 
activities; anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e.: “Advil”, “Aleve”). If poor or no 
improvement is shown, then, local corticosteroid injection may be 
considered.
