Treatment and management of ovarian cysts usually depend on the size of the 
cysts. There are some studies which show evidence that contraceptive pills 
can reduce the size of ovarian cysts. Oral contraceptive pill is a good 
option for you if you are planning to conceive. You may talk to your OB on 
what you should do about the new cyst. I think for now, continuous 
monitoring is preferable. Cystectomy (surgical removal of the cyst) is also 
an option but the benefits should outweigh the risks. The last resort is 
oophorectomy (removal of the ovary); this is usually done in women with 
suspicious ovarian cysts, postmenopausal age, or when the cyst is too 
large. I hope this helps and I wish you well always.
