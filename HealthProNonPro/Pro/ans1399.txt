The most common causes of snoring in children are sinusitis or adenoid 
enlargement. Sinusitis is treated with antibiotics and decongestants; 
adenoid enlargement treated with surgery (removal of tonsils and adenoids). 
Also possible is choanal atresia, a congenital closure of the back of the 
nose which also requires surgery for correction. Allergies are almost never 
present in infants. Snoring may be an early indicator of asthma in 
children. Some research studies have found that 40% of pre-school children 
who snored and then developed a nighttime cough were ultimately diagnosed 
with asthma. I suggest that you consult a specialist in allergies because 
maybe your son is having an allergy problem at the other parent’s place. 
Also it would be important to rule out a obstructive sleep apnea (periods 
of not breathing, typically followed by a gasp or snort).
