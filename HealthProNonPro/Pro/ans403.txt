I do realise that you are going through a lot, but there is no easy answer 
to your problems. In my opinion you may be suffering from Post 
cholecystectomy syndrome (PCS). This complication occurs in 5-30% of 
patients post gall bladder surgery. What cause this is poorly understood 
and may be due to the alteration of bile flow post surgery. Symptoms of PCS 
include abdominal pain, bloating, loose stools, nausea and jaundice. Some 
studies have shown that PCS develops after 3 months of surgery and is most 
likely related to a change in diet. There is no easy way to treat PCS. 
Usually this is a relative diagnosis until an underlying co-morbidity is 
found. The first-line of treatment after diagnosis has been made is through 
antacids, H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors to relieved the bloating 
sensation, cholestyramine for loose stools and a high fiber, low fat diet. 
Patient with persistent symptoms may respond to a ERCP which is both a 
diagnostic and a therapeutic procedure. I hope that this information would 
help you to get some answers. I wish you well, take care.
