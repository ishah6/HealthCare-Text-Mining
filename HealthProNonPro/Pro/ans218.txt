Deciduous or primary teeth appear by the age of six to seven months and is 
important for chewing and speech. They usually fall off at the age of 6-7 
years after which the permanent of secondary teeth appear. Your daughter 
has broken her primary/milk teeth and this will have no effect on the 
development of her permanent teeth. I would suggest you to show your 
daughter to a dentist for replacement of the broken teeth by space 
maintainers to allow for proper aesthetics, speech and chewing.
