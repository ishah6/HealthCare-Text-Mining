The incubation period is about 34 years.  When the symptoms first start to show-up, you know you are in for one heck of a cold!  Symptoms usually start to appear after youve had lots of fun, for instance a company Christmas party. When the molecules in your body are fully charged after a good intoxication, they suddenly all break apart into little particles similar to dust.  You begin to sneeze to rid your body of these molecules.  Once all the three-double-kazillion molecules have safely been sneezed out of your body, your body than begins to form new molecules waiting to incubate for your next intoxication.  I hope that helped.
