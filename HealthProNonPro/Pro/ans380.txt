Home treatment of STDs is not recommended, because the treatment will 
depend on the pathogen. The azithromycin may prevent chlamydia infection 
but will not be effective in treating other causes like trichomonas, 
herpes, gonorrhea and bacterial vaginosis. I would advice you to consult 
your doctor if you suspect that you may have contracted one. Blood tests 
and microscopical examination of vaginal swabs may help to diagnose the 
infection.
