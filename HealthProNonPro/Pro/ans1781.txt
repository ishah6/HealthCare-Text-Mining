You may be suffering from gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). The 
cardinal symptoms associated with GERD are heartburn and regurgitation. 
GERD is associated with symptoms or mucosal injury, often including 
nocturnal episodes. The most common symptoms of GERD are heartburn (or 
pyrosis), regurgitation, and dysphagia. In addition, a variety of 
extraesophageal manifestations have been described including bronchospasm, 
laryngitis, and chronic cough. Heartburn is typically described as a 
burning sensation in the retrosternal area (behind the breastbone). 
Regurgitation is defined as the perception of flow of refluxed gastric 
content into the mouth. It is neither necessary nor practical to initiate a 
diagnostic evaluation in every patient with heartburn. your doctor may want 
to see a symptomatic response to antisecretory therapy with proton pump 
inhibitors or H2 antagonists before asking for any other tests like 
GI endoscopy and pH monitoring.
