Refined sugar is an addictive and destructive POISON. You should get all your sugar needs from natural sources, NO refined sugar. 
(Oh important note: Brown sugar is NOT "unrefined" sugar. It is white refined sugar with molasses (sugar syrup) added to it! It is just as deadly and poisonous as any "white" sugar!!!)

I recommend that you try to find a copy of William Duftys famous book "Sugar Blues," heres a taste of what he says:

THE SHOCKER THAT CURED MILLIONS OF THE "SUGAR BLUES" WILL IT CURE YOU TOO?

Its a prime ingredient in countless substances that we eat and drink, from cereal to soup, from cola to coffee. Consumed at the rate of one hundred pounds for every American every year, its as addictive as nicotine or heroin -- and as poisonous, responsible for modern plagues ranging from depression to coronary thrombosis. Its sugar. And SUGAR BLUES, inspired by the crusade of Hollywood legend Gloria Swanson, is the classic best selling expose that unmasks our generation greatest medical killer -- yet, at the same time, shows how a revitalizing, sugar-free diet can not only change your life, but quite possibly save it.

"A relentless, hard-hitting report. You are unlikely ever to feel quite the same about sugar." --Chicago Tribune

"One of the most revealing, instructive, and helpful books ever written." --Lets Live magazine
