A common cause of headaches is tension-type headache (TTH) which usually 
occurs without changing much in intensity or limiting daily activity and is 
not associated with serious disease. You will need to identify the triggers 
for the headache like insufficient sleep, fasting, hunger, brightness, 
stress, tension etc. Eating a healthy diet and daily exercise may help 
improve your headaches. You may also perform meditation, yoga, deep 
breathing or other relaxation exercises to reduce stress. Over the counter 
pain medication like advil and motrin will help relieve the symptoms.
