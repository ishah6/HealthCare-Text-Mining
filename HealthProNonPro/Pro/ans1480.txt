The symptoms of bloating and burping may be caused due to certain foods 
like beans, broccoli, cauliflower, cabbage, sprouts, onions and garlic, 
reflux disease or infection with H. Pylori. I would suggest that you see a 
gastroenterologist for an upper GI endoscopy and a urease breath test to 
rule out infection with H. Pylori. Treatment will depend on the cause. In 
addition i would advice you to analyze the food that you are eating. You 
can also try taking digestive enzymes as well as probiotics which will help 
improve the normal flora of your intestine and may help in relieving or 
preventing the symptoms.
