Most lumps in the skin are benign and are commonly due to lipomas, 
sebaceous cysts or epidermoid cysts. Lipomas are benign fatty lumps found 
in between the skin and the muscle. It is usually not tender and no 
treatment is necessary. Surgical excision is only warranted for cosmetic 
reasons. Sebaceous cyst is formed due to trauma or an inflamed hair 
follicle into which keratin is secreted. These are usually tender to touch 
and may be inflamed. Warm compresses may help in acute conditions with 
surgical excision only required for severe cases.
