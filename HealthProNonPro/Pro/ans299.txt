Fiberoptic endoscopy of the upper GI tract is the investigation of choice 
when it comes to diagnosing patients with suspected gastric ulcer. However, 
endoscopic examination are more invasive and costly as compared to 
double-contrast barium studies.I would suggest that you consult your doctor for double contrast barium 
examination which has been shown to have a sensitivity as high as 95% in 
the detection of a gastric pathology and is a useful alternative to 
endoscopy. The drawback is that a biopsy is not possible when there is a 
suspected lesion. CT and MRI have no part in the primary detection of 
gastric ulcer.
