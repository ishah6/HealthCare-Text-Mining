Thank you for your question. Your symptoms are not consistent with 
Tuberculosis based on your description. It is possible that your weight 
gain is due to a side effect of the combination of your medications. The 
fever that you are experiencing could also be due to the medications or the 
build up of uric acid in your blood. We are not certain as to why you were 
prescribed these medications, and therefore we recommend that you follow up 
with your personal physician to determine if you still need to be on these 
medication. If not, perhaps by simply stopping them can improve your 
symptoms. Please see your doctor.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
