Occasionally missing a period is not necessarily dangerous, but long-term 
amenorrhea can be. Though missed periods or amenorrhea may be due to 
excessive exercise. I would however advice you to do a home pregnancy test 
to rule out pregnancy as the cause of amenorrhea. If you are experiencing 
missed periods, you should consult your doctor.
