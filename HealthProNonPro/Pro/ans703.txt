It is difficult for me to say whether you have HIV or not. You should 
consider getting tested for HIV infection if you or your partner had 
unprotected sex, tested positive for sexually transmitted infection, had 
tattooing, piercing or acupuncture with unsterilized equipment.HIV testing is important in your case because a negative result will help 
relieve the stress and anxiety in your life. If the test comes out 
positive, you can get early treatment to stay healthy. HIV testing is 
anonymous and confidential and only you have the access to the results.
