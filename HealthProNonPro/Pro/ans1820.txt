Your itching could be caused due to an allergy, most probably to new 
clothes or dust mites. I would suggest that you try to eliminate any 
product that might have brought about the reaction and take over the 
counter anti-histamines to decrease the symptoms of itching. If your 
symptoms do not decrease by these measures, I would suggest that you 
consult your dermatologist. I wish you well, take care.
