Pain and spotting could be an indicator of pelvic inflammatory disease, 
fibroids, endometriosis or in rare cases cancer to the endometrium/uterus. 
Any bleeding warrants an internal examination from your obstetrician. Your 
doctor may advise further test according to the findings of the 
examination. Treatment will depend on the cause of the bleeding.
