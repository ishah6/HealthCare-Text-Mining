How to restore 20/20 vision.

Exercise 1:  
hold your index finger six inches from your nose. look at it for 2 seconds then look at an object 20 feet away, and then look at your index finger again. keep doing this for a few minutes.

Exercise 2:
imagine you are looking at a giant clock. raise your eyes to the ceiling to look at the 12 as far as they will go. hold them there for a few seconds then bring them back to the centre.  then look at the 1 for a few seconds as far as your eyes will go and then back to the centre. keep doing this until you look at all the numbers.

Exercise 3:
look at the imaginary giant clock again but this time instead of bringing your eyes back to the centre, move your eyes to the next digit on the clock and hold them at each number for a few seconds.

Repeat exercises 2 and 3 but going counter-clockwise.

Within a few days you should see a vast improvement (no pun intended).
