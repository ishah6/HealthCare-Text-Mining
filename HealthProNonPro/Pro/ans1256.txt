Thank you for your question. These seems to be more of a problem with 
balance rather than a problem with your ankle. You have not described that 
you are experiencing any pain in the ankle joint, muscle spasms, or even 
weakness, which leads us to believe that when you are walking on uneven 
surfaces you are simply loosing your balance. We do recommend that you have 
this examined by your doctor to rule out any serious problems with your 
ankle and also have a neurological examination performed to make sure you 
are not experiencing any balance problems.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
