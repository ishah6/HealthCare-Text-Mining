You are most probably having a viral gastroenteritis or stomach flu. These 
viruses are often found in contaminated food or drinking water. Symptoms of 
viral gastroenteritis usually appear within 4 - 48 hours after exposure to 
the contaminated food or water.The goal of treatment is to make sure that you are adequately hydrated. 
Antibiotics do not work for viruses. Most infections will go away on their 
own without treatment. You will need to see your health care provider if 
you notice blood in stool or develop fever and severe abdominal pain.
