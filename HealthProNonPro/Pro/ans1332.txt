The Core decompression of the hip is a surgical procedure that removes the 
inner layer of bone, which reduces pressure within the bone, increases 
blood flow to the bone, and allows more blood vessels to form. Core 
decompression works best in people who are in the earliest stages of 
avascular necrosis, often before the collapse of the joint. This procedure 
sometimes can reduce pain and slow the progression of bone and joint 
destruction. The first 4 weeks after the surgery you should not bear weight 
and use crutches, go to physical therapy and regain passive range of 
movements. You should have X-rays to check the healing bone process and 
accordingly proceed with the Rehab . Between 4 and 8 weeks you should 
progressively bear weight, first partially and progress to complete. After 
the week 8 you can do gentle walking and light stretching, pool exercises, 
then when close to week 12, if everything goes fine, you could do short 
sprints, shuttle runs, gradual jogging and you will be on your way to full 
recovery.
