I do understand your concern. Breast cancer can recur at any time, but most 
recurrences occur in the first three to five years after initial treatment. 
Breast cancer can come back as a local recurrence (in the treated breast or 
near the mastectomy scar) or as a distant recurrence somewhere else in the 
body. The most common sites of recurrence include the lymph nodes, the 
bones, liver, or lungs. There are several factors that may increase the 
risk of recurrence, and these are the number of lymph nodes in which cancer 
has been found, tumor size, histological grading, Lymphatic Vessel Invasion 
and Hormone receptor status. The best thing you can do after receiving a 
breast cancer diagnosis is to follow up with your doctor regularly and 
inform if you notice any changes in the area where you had your original 
breast surgery or in your other breast, including Skin changes, such as 
reddening, swelling, scaling, puckering, mass, lump, or thickening in the 
breast tissue and nipple changes.
