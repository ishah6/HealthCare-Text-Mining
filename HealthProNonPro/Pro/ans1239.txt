Thank you for your question. The use of antibiotics can indeed have a side 
effect of causing changes in one's taste or even the development of the 
perception of the complete loss of the ability to taste. We do believe that 
this is something that should be carefully examined by another doctor in 
person. The restoration of your sense of taste after this antibiotic course 
can take months to resolve, with the slight risk of permanent loss or 
changes in your taste. For this reason were recommend that you promptly 
consult another physician in order to determine if you can stop this 
medication to restore your taste without effecting the treatment of your 
acne.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
