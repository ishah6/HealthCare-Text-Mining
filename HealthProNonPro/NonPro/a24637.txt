I think that it would be a great idea to legalize it. I know people that use it for medecinal purposes and I only wish I had when I had cancer. Being I did not like pain meds.I hear it would have helped with the pain. And besides who has ever heard of a pot ahead driver?? I have never seen on the news.."hit by pot head". Only DRUNK drivers. Most people that smoke this stuff dont do it and drive, I would say they are to stoned to get off the couch.LOL Any ways, I really have nothing against the legalization of this so called drug. I mean it grows natrual in the woods mostly. My great Grandma used to call it "wacky Weed" she was Indian. It grew with all the other weeds in the fields. Alcohol on the other hand is man made and its legal!Also some 6.500 years ago in China the Yang-shao used hemp for their clothes,nets for fishing and hunting,and the ropes used in their earliest machaines. Because hemp (marijuana seeds) were a very durable fiber and strong.Plus it was used to cure things like worms found in animals and various other things. You would be suprised. Plus as others have said in their answers the government would make millions instead of spending millions on trying to keep it "illigal". This is only my opinion. But, I strongly believe that this drug would beneifate alot of people going through a terminal illness. Crime rate would go down a conciderable amount, jail houses wouldnt be full all the time,Judges would have more time for more important cases (like murder) and tax payers wouldnt be paying the price!! I have never tried it but in the event that God desides I get sick again one day..I hope it is legal because I would definately ask for it from my Doctor! Plus..its not addicting like many drugs that are legal. I hope I was of some help with your paper and have a good day.
