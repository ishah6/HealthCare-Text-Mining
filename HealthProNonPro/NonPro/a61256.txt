Because you realy have nothing. If you are drunk all the time, you are letting a foreign substance control your thoughts and how you act. You have lost the very sense of who you realy are. Perhaps the alcohol is the reason your making the poor decisons as well.

  Things can not make you happy unless you can enjoy them without getting drunk....and even then you need more then just cool stuff.

   And how many friends would you still have if you didnt have this "Stuff" and quit drinking...?

Do you have everything? Perhaps alot of material side, but on the inside of yourself you are lacking. You need to refocus and start over.
