No, those things that you did will not affect the recovery, make sure that 
you apply consistently the topical antibiotic prescribed by your doctor, 
keep the area clean, wear open-toed shoes or sandals until you feel better, 
if there is pain you can take over-the-counter pain relievers as 
acetaminophen (“Tylenol”). In the future, trim your nails straight across 
not too short, wear shoes that fit you properly.
