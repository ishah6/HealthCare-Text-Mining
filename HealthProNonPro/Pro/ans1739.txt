While tonalin at recommended doses are safe for most, it's reaction with 
other drugs including phentermine has not been studied yet. Tonalin may 
cause symptoms of upset stomach, nausea, diarrhea, heartburn, indigestion 
and fatigue in some users. I would suggest that you consult your doctor or 
pharmacist before taking these two together.
