Allegra is an antihistamine; I believe its taken internally, and it will address some of the symptoms of an airborne allergy--runny nose, itchy eyes, achy muscles, etc.

Benadryl is a topical anti-itch (and mildly anesthetic?) goo to reduce the itchiness of a bug bite or rash or whatever.  Not the same category as Allegra; its more like calamine lotion (white stuff often used for poison ivy/oak).
