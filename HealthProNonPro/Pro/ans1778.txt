You may be having bacterial vaginosis (vulvovaginitis). This is a caused 
when there is an overgrowth of normally residing flora (bacteria and/or 
fungi) on the vagina. Vulvovaginitis presents with vaginal discharge, 
irritation, and itching.I would suggest that you see your gynecologist for an internal examination 
and microscopic evaluation of the discharge. Treatment will depend on the 
organism present. Proper fitting and adequately absorbent clothing and good 
hygiene of the genital area will also help relieve the symptoms.
