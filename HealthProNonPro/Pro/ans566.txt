I understand your concern about the skin discoloration caused by yeast 
infection. Candidiasis in men usually causes red rash with white lesions on 
the head of the penis, and sometimes ulcerations, itchiness and dry flaking 
skin. The discoloration should resolve on its own and you do not need to be 
worried. However, if your partner also has a yeast infection, she needs to 
be treated too. Otherwise, you may keep re-infecting each other. Also, its 
generally recommended that you refrain from sexual contact until all signs 
and symptoms of the infection are gone. I wish you a prompt recovery.
