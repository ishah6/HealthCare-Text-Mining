Recovery from surgery is different in each patient. Factors that may 
influence your recovery include your age, the type of surgical procedure 
you had, and your general health. Presently, there are no official 
guidelines that have been established pertaining to the use of alcohol 
after having surgery. Drinking alcohol and smoking after surgery is 
strongly discouraged, especially while you are taking pain medications. I 
wish you well, take care.
