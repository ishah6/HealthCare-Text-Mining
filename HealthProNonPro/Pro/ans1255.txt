Thank you for your question. There is very little research studies showing 
the effect of procera cognitive enhancer with prescription medication. In 
fact, this product has not been tested for its claims and its safety by the 
FDA. In general, we do not recommend taking supplements with prescription 
medication because of how little is known about their interactions. We 
believe that you should air on the side of caution and refrain from taking 
procera while you are taking lorazepam and percocet.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
