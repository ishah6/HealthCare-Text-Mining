It hardly hurts at all. :) Most of the first precedure is just tedious waiting for glue to dry, etc. And if you have to have a tooth pulled, the orthodontist willl let you know beforehand.

The only part that does hurt is the putting in and tightening of wires. That can be really painful, but can easily be resolved by eating only soft foods (bananas, applesauce, ice cream...) for a while. Of course, sometimes the skin in mouth is rubbed raw by the braces, but the body automatically creates a callus there, preventing the problem in the future.

Ironically, Ive heard that it hurts more to get braces off than to get them on. :) And just think of what wonderful looking teeth youll have afterwards!
