Your symptoms are indicative of reflux disease. Gastroesophageal reflux 
disease (GERD) occurs when stomach acid or, occasionally, bile flows back 
into your food pipe (esophagus) and irritates the lining of your esophagus. 
Purlex (escitalopram) is also know to cause indigestion. I would suggest 
that you take over the counter antacid to relieve your symptoms. Anxiety 
and stress will also increase acid production in the stomach, leading to 
worsening of your symptoms. You can try meditation or yoga to decrease your 
anxiety level. Avoid coffee, tea and carbonated drinks since this also 
increases acid production. If your symptoms are not relieved by these 
measures, consult your doctor. You may then require more potent medications 
like H2 blockers and proton pump inhibitors and an upper GI endoscopy. I do 
hope I have appeased your concern, take care.
