Good Luck--its a pain when you have to be stuck in a hospital (I know.  I was in one for 4 weeks as a kid).  And with the needles, you cant even do anything with your hands to keep you busy.  You might try taking along some headphones and either books on tape or your favorite music--it will help pass the time if you can take your mind away from it.
