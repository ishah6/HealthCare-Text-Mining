Gonorrhea is a sexually transmitted disease and is caused by Neisseria 
gonorrhoeae. Gonorrhea is characterized by thick discharge from the penis 
or vagina. In addition to male reproductive organs & female genital tract, 
gonorrhea may infect the rectum, throat, eyes, blood, skin, & joints. 
Gonorrhea spreads through semen or vaginal fluids during unprotected sexual 
contact with an infected partner. Gonorrhea is tested by either a urine 
test or a swab test. Adults with gonorrhea are treated with antibiotics. 
Early treatment is simple & effective, & involves a single dose of 
antibiotics. In addition, the treatment of chlamydia is also advocated. To 
avoid re-infection, any sexual partners should be treated too. 
Unfortunately metronidazole is not effective for the treatment of gonorrhea 
and is used if you have bacterial vaginosis. I would advise that you see 
your doctor for a urine or swab test and appropriate antibiotics if 
positive.
