Forced movements (rotational, flex-ext) or direct blows to the knee may 
produce injury of the tendons, ligaments, menisci, bones or capsule. The 
suggested strategy for the initial treatment of a knee tendinitis includes: 
use of local ice, rest, avoid painful movements and/or activities, 
elevation of the leg, anti-inflammatory over the counter medication (as 
“advil”, “motrin”) and the use of a knee immobilizer as needed. Physical 
therapy is very useful to manage pain and inflammation, also to regain 
range of movements. If all these directions are followed, then the normal 
function should return in few days to weeks, the healing time depends on 
the severity of the initial injury and on every patient in particular, but 
if there is still pain, swelling and/or limitation on the movements, then, 
I strongly recommend an evaluation by an Orthopedic Surgeon to decide about 
the right imaging studies to order and determine the best treatment option 
for you.
