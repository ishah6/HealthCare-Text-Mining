Thank you for your question. Your dizziness could be related to a 
circulation problem within the brain or the heart. It is possible that less 
oxygenated blood is transiently being supplied to your brain resulting in 
your dizzy spells. Drops in blood pressure could also cause this, as seen 
in a condition known as orthostatic hypotension. We strongly recommend that 
you follow up with your doctor to have this examined an make sure you are 
not suffering from any serious heart condition such as aoritc stenosis, or 
transient ischemic attacks of the brain.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
