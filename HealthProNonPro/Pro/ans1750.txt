Yes, herpes can be transmitted through oral sex. Anyone with active disease 
should avoid any sexual contact when sores are present. Even the use of 
condoms does not prevent the spread of disease because not all sores are 
covered by the condom.HSV can be vertically transmitted to the infant before, during, or after 
delivery. Mothers who acquire genital herpes in the last few weeks of 
pregnancy are at the highest risk of transmitting the virus to their 
infants. Herpes infection in infants may cause serious neurological damage, 
mental retardation or death.I would advice you to practice safe sex, to abstain from sex if lesions/ 
vesicles are present on the genital area and keep a look out for symptoms 
of HSV1 which include tingling , burning in the area followed by vesicle 
eruption. You may need to see your doctor in the presence of these symptoms.
