In the view that you do not specify where the fracture is, my answer will 
be very general. The child's bones are softer and more flexible than those 
of an adult, so they're more likely to bend than to break completely. This 
flexibility can result in a greenstick fracture. In a greenstick fracture, 
the bone cracks but doesn't break all the way through — like when you try 
to break a green stick of wood. A greenstick fracture can be difficult to 
diagnose, because it may not cause all the classic signs and symptoms of a 
broken bone. Broken bones, even greenstick fractures, need to be 
immobilized so that they can grow back together. Casts are the most common 
way to keep a bone still, but your doctor may decide that a removable 
splint could work just as well. The benefit of a splint is that you might 
be able to take it off briefly for a bath or shower. Your doctor may want 
to X-ray the bone again at a later date to make sure it's healing properly. 
Children's bones tend to heal faster than do those of adults, so your cast 
or splint may be removed or replaced with a smaller cast in as little as 
three to four weeks.
