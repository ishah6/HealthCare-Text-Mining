I do understand your concern. You have not mentioned the age of your 
daughter. The most common cause of vomiting in children is gastroenteritis 
or stomach flu. Virus are the most common cause of gastroenteritis and no 
treatment is required other that adequate fluid intake. In newborns, 
recurrent vomiting can also be a sign of reflux. However, since your child 
has been vomiting for 5 days, I would suggest that you take her to a 
pediatrician for blood-work, stool tests and ultrasound.
