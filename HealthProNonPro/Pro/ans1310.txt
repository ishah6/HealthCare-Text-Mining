The bleeding could be caused by remaining stone fragments or an infection. 
I would advise you to take plenty of oral fluids to help in flushing the 
stone and bacteria. Cranberry juice is also recommended to provide 
symptomatic relief. If the hematuria (blood in urine) continues, I would 
advise you to consult your doctor. A cystoscopy may be required to locate 
the site of bleed.
