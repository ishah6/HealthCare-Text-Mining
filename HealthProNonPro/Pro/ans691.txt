It is difficult for me to recommend a weight loss supplement. Most weight 
loss supplements have side effects and their effects have not been studied 
in the long term. Most of the fat burners in the market contain Ephedra, 
Pyruvate and/or hydroxycitrate stimulate the heart and nervous system; most 
manufacturers claim this can help burn fat. Side effects include nausea, 
insomnia, high blood pressure, headaches, among others. Acai and green tea 
are also often used to lose weight. If you are eating healthy, getting the 
right amounts of all food groups and controlling the caloric intake along 
with a moderate activity level, you will definitely lose weight weight with 
or without the use of supplements.
