You are not overweight, you are the right weight for your height. i would combine everslim with regular exercise. You can take walks other kinds of exercise.Your doing good, maybe eat lot of veggies, 
but no starve diets.If you lose to much too fast
chances are the weight will come back because your body 
will think its starving .
