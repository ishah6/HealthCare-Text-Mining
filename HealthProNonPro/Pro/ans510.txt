I do understand your concern. Most cases of flu and cold are caused by 
viral infection which run its course and no treatment is required. The 
nosebleed should resolve as the symptoms of flu subside.I would advise that 
you refrain from vigorous nose blowing. If your symptoms do not resolve, 
you may need to see an ENT specialist.
