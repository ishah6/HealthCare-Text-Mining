The likely cause of your shoulder pain could be caused by an impinged 
tendon or nerve, or an injury to the rotator cuff. Usually rest, ice packs 
and pain-killers are enough to treat the pain. I would advise you to 
continue what you are doing and if the pain does not subside with these 
measures, you may have to visit a doctor for a complete physical 
examination of the shoulder. X-rays may not be helpful in the diagnosis and 
MRI may be indicated in severe cases of pain.
