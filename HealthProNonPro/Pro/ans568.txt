I understand your concern for your mother-in-law's symptoms post menopause. 
Women often experience a variety of symptoms that include hot flashes or 
flushes, insomnia, weight gain and bloating, mood changes, irregular 
menses, mastodynia, depression, and headache. Women who are in menopause 
may be prone for osteoporosis and coronary artery disease.Your mother-in-law may need to see her doctor to see whether hormonal 
replacement therapy may be beneficial to supress the symptoms she is 
experiencing.
