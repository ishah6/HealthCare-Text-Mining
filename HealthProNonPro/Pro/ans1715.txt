What you are describing, seems to be caused by folliculitis which now has 
become into an abscess with pus discharge. Folliculitis is the inflammation 
of the hair folliciles due to tight clothing, shaving or when the pores get 
blocked. Most of the time warm compresses and oral or topical antibiotics 
(mupirocin) help to resolve the folliculitis. I would advice you not to put 
any other material on the boil. Since you have described an abscess which 
is draining pus, I would have you consult a doctor to see whether the 
abscess may require surgical drainage.
