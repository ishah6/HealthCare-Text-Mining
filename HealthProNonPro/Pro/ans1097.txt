Syphilis is a venereal disease, a STD ( sexual transmitted disease) caused 
by infection with a spirochete called:Treponema pallidum. It is transmitted 
by having sexual contact with an infected individual; it can also be 
acquired via exposure to infected blood.Regardless of the fact that your partner is free from infection or not 
after his treatment, you may still want to take a test for syphilis just to 
be safe. You must use condoms until a definite diagnosis has been made. 
Take care.
