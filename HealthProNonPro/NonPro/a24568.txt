1) Eat a lot, meaning much more than you are used to.  And keep it up.  Your stomach will expand and you will be able to eat even more.
2) Low reps, heavy weights on your exercises in the gym.
3) Do power/mass building exercises, including Squats, Deadlifts, Bench Press.  Use free weights, but not dumbells, and for crying out loud, stay away from that nautilus/universal machine crap.
4) Whey protein is good too.
5) Creatine.  Its a great supplement, itll help you put on weight, it definitely increases strength, and its safe and legal.
