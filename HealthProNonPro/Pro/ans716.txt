It is difficult to make a diagnosis of depression on certain symptoms 
alone. Depression is classified as a mood disorder. All mood disorders are 
diagnosed by examining mood episodes the patient is experiencing. A 
thorough history and physical exam has to be undertaken to ensure you 
symptoms are not better explained by other medical conditions. In order to 
diagnose depression, health professionals rely on the Diagnostic and 
statistical manual of mental disorders published by the American 
Psychiatric Association. There are other psychiatric disorders that 
primarily affect your mood and include: dysthymia, bipolar I, bipolar II, 
cyclothymia. In order to diagnose a mood disorder, your partner's health 
care practitioner will determine what type of mood state or mood episode 
your partner is currently experiencing or have experienced in the past. 
Depression can be difficult to diagnose in one visit. I would suggest that 
you take your partner to his doctor for further evaluation.
