Thank you for your question. It is possible that this 'birth mark' could be 
a benign nevus, or mole. These are areas of excessive pigment production in 
a localized, circular fashion. Albeit rare, they can also occur on the 
surface of the glans penis. It is important to have this examined by your 
doctor. We cannot tell you definitively that this lesion on your glans 
penis is not serious, if it will go away on its own, without being able to 
see it. For this reason, we believe that given the sensitive area that this 
lesion is in, you should have it examined by your doctor. Upon examination, 
the best possible options will be presented to you and you will be able to 
determine whether this can be removed using topical medications or surgery.
