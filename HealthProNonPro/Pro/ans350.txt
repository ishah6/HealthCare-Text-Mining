Having a cataract in one eye limits the field of vision to qualify for a 
driver's licence. Cataracts also lead to loss of contrast sensitivity, dark 
adaptation and glare recovery. Different countries have different rules and 
recommendation. You may definitely be able to drive with one good eye, but 
it may not be a surety that you will pass the driving test.
