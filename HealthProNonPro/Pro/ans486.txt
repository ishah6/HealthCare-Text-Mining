I do understand your concern. Although fibroadenoma is a long-term risk 
factor for breast cancer, the risk is increased in women with complex 
fibroadenomas, proliferative disease, or a family history of breast cancer. 
It is difficult for me to comment on the possibility that the lump could be 
cancerous. A biopsy of the lump is needed to rule out underlying cancer.
