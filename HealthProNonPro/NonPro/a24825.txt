try to start your day with a food that give you energy to help you cleanse  without using a lot of energy to digest
the best food is fresh squeezed fruit or vegetables
used your own juicer with fresh fruit or vegetable
and drink alot of water

eat salad before lunch and dinner
make you feel full without eating too much

and good combination
dont mix youf protein with carb
for example
if you eat meat try eat with vegetable
if you want  potato( not fried) try with vegetable

pasta bread is a bad source of carb cos its mixes between carb and protein
bread contain flour and milk and egg 
pasta has egg and flour
good source of carb is rice, potatoed
and peas is also a protein not a just a vegetable

that is why the speak alot about whole grain 
but if you still eating your whole grain as a form of  bagel , muffin and bread or pasta
you may aswell  eat you hamburger

be better to eat raw vegetabables than steam
cut down your fried food or grill
be better if it steam for meat 
and  eat fruit 30 min before you eat your food 
other wise you dont have a good benefit out of fruit

if you do this for 2 week at least 
you will feel better and healtier 
there nothing too loose to try this
