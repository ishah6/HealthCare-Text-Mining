It is normal that after the cast removal, the elbow joint be stiff and 
painful with the movements and to the touch, that’s why is so important the 
rehabilitation after immobilization. The longer the elbow is immobilized, 
the larger the flexion contracture and the more severe the pain. The first 
PT sessions are expected to be a little bit difficult and painful but the 
more movement and PT you do the more improvement you will get in the long 
run. It is a key concept in rehab post elbow dislocations that a short 
immobilization period (2-3 weeks) followed by and early, directed rehab 
process , allow early return to the daily living activities and sports 
participation.
