Thank you for your question. There is no significant evidence that draws 
puts larger sized children at a higher risk of developing an enlarged 
heart. Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, is a genetic disorder of the heart 
which causes the heart muscle to dangerously enlarge. This increases the 
risk of sudden cardiac arrest. This can only be diagnosed by a cardiologist 
after extensive testing and diagnostic imaging. If your child is engaging 
in a lot of sports, it is important that he is medically cleared by a 
doctor to make sure it is safe for him to play sports.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
