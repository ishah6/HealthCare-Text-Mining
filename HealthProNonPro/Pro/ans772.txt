It is understandable to be concerned about presence of bumps in the penis. 
Though most bumps of papules are benign, it is advisable to consult your 
doctor. The bumps/papules could be caused by a sexually transmitted 
infection, penile warts or pearly penile papules. I do hope I have answered 
your question, take care.
