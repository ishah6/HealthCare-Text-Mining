You may use Capsaicin which is available as a cream, ointment, stick, pad, 
gel, liquid, or lotion. It is marketed under many brand names including 
Zostrix, Icy Hot Arthritis Therapy, Capsagel, and Arthricare for Women. You 
do not need a prescription for capsaicin. You can find products containing 
capsaicin in the drugstore for over-the-counter purchase. You should follow 
the directions given by your doctor or the directions on the label (there 
are different dosages or strengths of capsaicin available). For pain 
relief, capsaicin is usually used 3 or 4 times a day. You should rub the 
capsaicin cream or gel into the painful area until no more cream is visible 
on the skin. Wash hands thoroughly after applying capsaicin. Even with 
regular use of capsaicin, arthritis pain relief will take some time. Pain 
relief from arthritis typically is evident 1 to 2 weeks after starting 
capsaicin. To prevent pain from returning, capsaicin must be continued. 
However, if pain is not better after using capsaicin for 3 or 4 weeks, talk 
to your doctor. It may not be worth it to continue.
