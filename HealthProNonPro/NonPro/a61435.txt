That is a strange question only because just about everything has some kind of sugar in it, wither it is natural or not. 
And everything is okay as long as it is consumed in moderation.
and as a part of your daily intake everyone is different, it depends on your weight, how many calories you are taking in and if you are watching your fat and sugar intake....remember there are other names on packages that are used for sugar instead of just saying sugar.
You should talk to your doctor to have a better idea of what you yourself should limit to be a healthy part of your life and life style.
