The chances of becoming pregnant while having unprotected sex is high, but 
this usually depend on what day of the cycle you had sex. For example in a 
normal 28 day cycle (day 1 is when the period starts), the ovulation takes 
place at the 14th day. Therefore there is higher chances of pregnancy if 
you had sex 3 days before or after ovulation. To be completely sure you 
need to do a urine pregnancy test. Also you have mentioned about stabbing 
pains in the left lower abdomen, I would advise you to get for urine tested 
for infection. Please ensure that you practise safe sexual habits by using 
condoms during sex to avoid becoming pregnant and contracting STIs, take 
care.
