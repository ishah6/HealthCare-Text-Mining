There are various factors that influence the chances of conception. It 
depends on the day of the sexual activity in relation to the period and 
whether there is an underlying problems causing infertility in both husband 
and wife. In your case, you have a period length of around 30 days 
approximately. The ovulation period would be sometime on day 13-15 day of 
your menstrual cycle, so any sexual intercourse during this period greatly 
increases the chances of pregnancy. It is not always certain that an 
individual ovulates at the middle of her cycle, so that uncertainty 
remains. Also factors like quality of the sperms, STIs and any diseases of 
the reproductive organs may hamper the chances of pregnancy. If you do not 
get pregnant after 3-4 months on unprotected sexual activity, visit your 
family doctor to test for problems of infection, endocrinological problems 
like hypo and hyperthyroidism and immunological conditions that may be 
present. I hope the answer helps you, I wish you well.
