It sounds like, to me, hes got a drinking problem. I think you already knew that though as you put that he was drinking all those nights. I would suggest making him improve the situation by getting off the liquor before it gets more serious than it already is. If hes becoming a violent drunk things could get much worse than him yelling at you. If hes not willing to drop the habit for you drop him. 

It seems like hes a very lucky guy whos willing to throw that away so be can get drunk. If youre going to try to get something serious with a guy make sure hes willing to go out of his way to be serious with you. Please take my advice and try to make him stop drinking. Its always sad to see a woman stuck with a man who abuses her, and she doesnt think she can get any one else. Trust me you can there are plenty of guys out there who would treat you better. Hope this helps and I hope your situation improves.
