According to your description and the characteristics of the pain, most 
likely you may have an Intercostal Neuritis, which is not a serious 
condition but very annoying indeed and slow healing. By a spasm or a direct 
trauma, the intercostal nerve is injured, and that’s why you are feeling 
that stabbing pain , that may worsen every time you take a deep breath, 
sneeze or cough, even eat or drink. The suggested strategy would be: 
please, try to be patient and do not expect an overnight improvement,take 
the anti-inflammatory and pain medication , and also keep taking Vitamin 
B12 supplement. Local moist heat helps to ease the pain. Try to avoid 
activities that worsen the pain. The healing time is different to each 
patient in particular but generally takes about 6-8 weeks.
