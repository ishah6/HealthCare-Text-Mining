To anwer this question properly would require a trip to the doctor to do some blood tests. He would check your fasting sugar level in the blood and hopefully do am A1C test which would assess the amount of average sugar in the blood over the last three months.

Based on that information he could recommend a level appropriate to you. Keep in mind that the simple sugars i.e. fructose is best for you (natural form in fruit). The refined sugars are the worst.

Also note that simple carbohydratesand starches turn into sugar immediately upon being digested. Examples: white bread, pasta.

These can be just as bad as candy.
