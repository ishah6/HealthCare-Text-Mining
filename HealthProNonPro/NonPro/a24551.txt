Maybe because crying hasnt "worked" for you in the past, because you havent seen crying "work" for other people, because you havent seen many people you care about cry, because situations in which people cried you found unpleasant..  it may not be a problem unless it brings you great anxiety or is disrupting relationships, family, work, everyday living...
