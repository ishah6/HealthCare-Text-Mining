Thank you for your question. Strictly speaking, there are no 
contraindications for using a sauna if you have anemia. However, if your 
symptoms of anemia are severe enough we recommend that you avoid using 
saunas. For example, if on a particular day you are feeling lethargic, 
weak, have headaches, chest pain, or experiencing any infections, please 
avoid using the sauna. Depending on the type of anemia you have, you may 
want to consult your personal physician for more specific instruction on 
your ability to use the sauna.We hope AskTheDoctor.com has addressed your concern.
