A particular concern with recurrent staph infection is methicillin 
resistant staph aureus (MRSA). This strain of staph does not respond to 
normal antibiotics used in staph infection. A swab culture may identify 
this infection and treatment will depend on the antibiotic that the staph 
is sensitive to.
