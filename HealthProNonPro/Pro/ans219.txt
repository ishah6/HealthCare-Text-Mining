Decreased libido, or reduced sex drive is often accompanied with sexual 
disorders. The common causes of low libido in men include medications such 
as antidepressants and steroids, excessive alcohol, stress and fatigue, 
chronic illness, low testosterone and strain in the relationship.Treatment of decreased libido depends on the cause. I would advise a 
complete physical examination and blood tests with your doctor to rule out 
the above mentioned causes of low libido. Adopting a healthy lifestyle with 
a healthy diet and exercise, limiting alcohol and reducing stress can help 
resolve the problem. Other treatment options may include medications, 
testosterone replacement if the levels are low or counselling.
