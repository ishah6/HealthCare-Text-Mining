It is difficult for me to say what could be causing your chronic lower 
abdominal pain and weight loss. I would suggest that you consult a 
gastroenterologist to rule out irritable bowel disease or malabsorption 
syndrome. A complete blood count, stool analysis and colonoscopy may be 
done to determine the presence of an underlying problem.
