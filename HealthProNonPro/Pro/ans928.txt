Nickel allergy is one of the most common causes of allergic contact 
dermatitis. Due to the prolonged exposure of your daughter to the nickel 
coin, it is most probable that she has developed allergy to it. There is no 
cure for the allergy and you may have to wait till the coin is passed out 
with stools. The allergic rash may last upto a period of 2-4 weeks. 
Benadryl, corticosteroids and antihistamines may help to reduce the 
symptoms of the rash.
