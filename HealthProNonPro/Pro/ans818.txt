Kidney cysts are quite common and occurs in 50% of adults over 50 years of 
age. Kidney cysts can be simple or complex. Cysts usually do not grow 
during follow up examination, but they can grow to be very large, even 
larger than the kidney itself. Cysts can cause pain due to growth and 
stretching of the wall of the cyst, pressure on the kidneys, pressure on 
the drainage of the kidney, causing blockage and pressure on other organs 
(stomach, intestines). Sometimes infection of the cyst may lead to pain. I 
would suggest that you see your doctor for a complete physical examination 
and an ultrasound and blood work to rule out infection.
