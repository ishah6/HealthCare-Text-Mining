It is not uncommon the slight swelling of lower legs and feet when the 
person has been standing or walking a lot. If the swelling persists and is 
accompanied by other symptoms as shortness of breath, weight gain, skin 
problems, in this case some other conditions of kidney, heart, liver or 
blood vessels must be rule out. Also if you are taking hormones, for 
example hormone replacement therapy, is a well known cause of liquid 
retention and swollen feet. Some other causes of swollen feet are: eating a 
poor diet in salt and carbs, varicose veins, laxative abuse, diuretic 
abuse, drug abuse. The treatment depends on the cause but I can give you 
some general measures that may be helpful: drink plenty of water during the 
day, put your feet up (12 inches above the level of your heart for 10-15 
minutes, 3-4 times a day),do not abuse laxatives, use support stockings, 
try to exercise regularly to improve circulation, avoid standing or 
sitting for long periods of time.
