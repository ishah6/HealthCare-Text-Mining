Visual problems such as blurring, halos, blind spots, floaters may indicate 
an underlying eye problem and needs to be evaluated by a medical 
professional. Such changes may represent an eye disease, aging, eye injury, 
or a condition like diabetes that affects many organs in your body. You 
will need to be examined by an ophthalmologist to rule out presbyopia, 
cataracts, galucoma, retinopathy, macular degeneration and retinal 
detachment, all of which cause vision problems.
