Your symptoms suggest of a chronic sinusitis problem. This may be due to a 
bacterial infection or non-infectious causes such as allergy, 
gastroesophageal reflux and cystic fibrosis. Medical treatment is directed 
towards the causative factor, treating infections, reducing the 
inflammation and facilitating drainage from the sinuses.Treatment for chronic sinusitis involves a 3-4 week course of antibiotics, 
intranasal steroids, saline irrigation of the nose and decongestants. 
Avoiding smoking will also help relieve your symptoms. If your symptoms are 
not improved by these measures, I would advise you to consult an ENT 
specialist. Functional Endoscopic Sinus Surgery (FESS) is often advised in 
treating recurrent sinusitis.
