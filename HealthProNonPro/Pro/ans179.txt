Certainly, it is possible that your husband is having a Costochondritis, 
this pain is usually well localized but it may radiate across the chest and 
and over the arms. On the other hand, anterior and posterior chest pain may 
also result from involvement of the nerve roots of the cervical and upper 
thoracic spine by osteoarthritis, disc disease, etc. In the view that all 
the tests done for autoimmune disorder came back negative, he has history 
of GI problems, maybe I would have him a cardiology evaluation and if this 
comes back negative, most likely he has a Costochondritis, which is not a 
serious condition but very annoying indeed and slow healing. Usually by a 
spasm or a direct trauma the costochondral cartilage and nerve get injured, 
causing a stabbing pain to the palpation and every time you take a deep 
breath, sneeze or cough. The suggested strategy would be: please, try to be 
patient and do not expect an overnight improvement, take anti inflammatory 
medication (“Aleve”, “Motrin”), and also Vitamin B12 supplement. Local 
moist heat helps to ease the pain. Try to avoid activities that worsen the 
pain.
