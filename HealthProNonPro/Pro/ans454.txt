I do understand your concern for your daughter's blood pressure. Although 
many pregnant women with high blood pressure have healthy babies without 
serious problems, high blood pressure can be dangerous for both the mother 
and the fetus. Blood pressure is high if the top number is more than 140 
millimeters of mercury (mm Hg), or if the bottom number is more than 90 mm 
Hg. The effects of high blood pressure range from mild to severe. High 
blood pressure can harm the mother's kidneys and other organs, and it can 
cause low birth weight and early delivery. In the most serious cases, the 
mother develops preeclampsia. Preeclampsia is a condition that typically 
starts after the 20th week of pregnancy and is related to increased blood 
pressure and protein in the mother's urine (as a result of kidney 
problems). Preeclampsia affects the placenta, and it can affect the 
mother's kidney, liver, and brain. I would suggest that your daughter 
consult her doctor for more details. In most cases blood pressure return to 
normal after delivery. Though I would suggest that your daughter see her 
doctor for further evaluation. I wish your daughter well, I hope this helps.
