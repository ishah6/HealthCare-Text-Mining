Carotid artery disease is caused by the build up of plaque inside the 
carotid arteries, also known as atherosclerosis. The plaque consists of 
fat, cholesterol and inflammatory cells that are deposited on the walls of 
the arteries hardening them and decreasing the blood supply.Treatment of carotid artery disease depends on the extent the arteries are 
blocked. Initial management consists of life style modifications like : 
quitting smoking, controlling blood pressure, diabetes and cholesterol 
levels, health diet low in saturated fats, cholesterol and salts, mild 
exercise and limited alcohol intake.More severe disease will require invasive procedures : These may be i) 
carotid endarterectomy and ii) angioplasty with stent placement.Your doctor may also recommend antiplatelet medication like aspirin and 
clopidogrel to decrease the risk of stroke due to blood clots. Severe cases 
may even require warfarin (a blood thinner).
