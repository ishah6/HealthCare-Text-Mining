Acid reflux can certainly cause irritation and feeling of dryness of the 
throat. The acidic contents of the stomach reflux into the esophagus due to 
a weak esophageal sphincter causing the symptoms you've mentioned. Another 
cause of the sensation of dryness and pressurized symptoms may be due to 
snoring. If taking over the counter antacids like tums and ranitidine do 
not help, then you may need to consult your doctor. A upper GI endoscopy 
may help determine the cause of the symptoms. Avoid fatty and spicy meals, 
coffee and tea and avoid lying down after a meal.
