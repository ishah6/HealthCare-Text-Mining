Unfortunately it is difficult for one to tell whether one has HIV based on 
symptoms alone. The initial symptoms of HIV infection can be very 
unspecific as: fever, fatigue, night sweats, rash, swollen nodes, sore 
throat, headache, oral ulcers. The development of the disease is different 
among individuals. This state may last from a few months to more than 10 
years. Even though the person has no symptoms, he or she is contagious and 
can pass HIV to others. HIV infection is commonly diagnosed by blood tests 
that detect antibodies the immune system produces in an attempt to fight 
the virus. It usually takes about 6 months for the test results to become 
accurate. In case of doubt, worry or if you are unsure, you may need to be 
tested after 6 months.
