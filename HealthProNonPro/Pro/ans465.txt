I do understand your concern that hypothyroidism can affect the mental and 
overall health status of your baby. Studies have shown that thyroid hormone 
plays an important role in the normal development of the brain. The sources 
of thyroid hormone in a fetus is from the mother and it's own (thyroid 
production in a fetus begins at 10-12 weeks of gestation).Gestational hypothyroidism can lead to several complications, notably 
preeclampsia, low birth weight and increased risk of spontaneous 
miscarriage. Although effects of maternal hypothyroidism on fetal brain 
development are not well defined, several recent reports indicate that IQ 
is modestly affected. It was also seen that thyroid hormone replacement 
apparently prevented effects on the child's IQ. One study also showed that 
there was no effect of severe first trimester hypothyroidism when mothers 
had normal thyroid function later in pregnancy, children developed normal 
IQ measured at 4-10 years.Most studies infere that if your thyroid levels are under control, the risk 
of your child developing a low IQ is less than half as compared to being 
untreated.
