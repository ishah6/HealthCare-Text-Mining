There are many structures that are present in your palm that can cause you 
pain. Injury to the bones, muscles, tendons, nerves and fascia all lead to 
pain in the palm. Taking into consideration that you used to do push-ups 
and lift bench weights, I would think of in the lines of carpal tunnel 
syndrome and tendinitis. The treatment for any pain in the palm is rest, 
over the counter painkillers/NSAIDS, ice packs and compression bandage. If 
these measures do not resolve your pain then I would suggest on seeing an 
orthopedic surgeon to further investigate the problem. In most of the cases 
x-ray of the joint may not provide much useful information and MRI may be 
needed.
