Some of it also depends on your weight when you begin, and how well you ate before.

I guess that a week should be manageable, and when you start finding yourself on floors/waking up without having gone to sleep will be an indication that you need to get some nutritious food in you.

Calories are usually not the problem, it is trace elements and vitamins.  (Eat sugar cubes for three weeks and die anyway.)

See a psychiatrist, and develop a plan with him/her.  You need not starve yourself over anything.
