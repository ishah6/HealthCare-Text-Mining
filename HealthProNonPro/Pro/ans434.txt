I do understand your concern due to the pain in the knee after the surgery. 
Though the pain could be due the weight that you accidental put on the 
affected leg, it is essential to rule out infection or collection of blood 
in the joints. If you experience fever, chills, persistent or increased 
pain and swelling of the joint, I would advise you to see your surgeon 
right away.
