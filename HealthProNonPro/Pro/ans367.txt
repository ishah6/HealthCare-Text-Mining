Herpesvirus type 1 (HSV-1) is transmitted primarily by contact with 
infected saliva and can cause genital herpes infections through oral sexual 
contact. The chance of spreading disease is greatest when sores are 
present. It is difficult to tell whether your boyfriend will have the 
disease, but if he has symptoms then it will be most probably due to HSV 1.
