It is difficult for me to tell whether you've had a premature rupture of 
membranes. Premature rupture of membranes occurs in about 3% of all 
pregnancies and leads to an early delivery, and complications in the child 
such as lung disease, developmental and neurological abnormalities. You 
have to visit the ER or uggently consult your doctor for further test and 
investigation to rule out premature rupture of membranes.
