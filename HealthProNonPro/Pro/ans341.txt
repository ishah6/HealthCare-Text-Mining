Greasy hair could be the result of increased sebum production by the scalp. 
There may not be a definite cause and these occurrences can be the result 
of both lifestyle factors and genetic predisposition. If your hair is 
greasy on a daily basis, I would suggest that you wash your hair regularly, 
avoid cosmetic hair products, avoid excess combing or brushing of hair and 
regularly massage your scalp while you shampoo your hair.
