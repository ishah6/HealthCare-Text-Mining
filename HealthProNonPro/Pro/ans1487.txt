The symptoms of numbness of the finger and toes in a diabetic are 
suggestive of diabetic neuropathy. This is result of the micro-vascular 
injury to the nerves and vessels due to diabetes. Even though you have 
mentioned an a1c level of 5.5, which is normal, I would suggest that you 
visit your doctor for a complete physical examination. If a diagnosis of 
peripheral neuropathy has been made, drugs like gabapentin, tricyclic 
antidepressants and SSRIs may be helpful in the treatment of symptoms.
