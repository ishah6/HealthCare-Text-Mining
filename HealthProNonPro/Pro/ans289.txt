Fatigue and increased tiredness can occur in normal healthy individuals. 
When fatigue becomes chronic, it needs to be investigated. Prolonged 
physical or mental exertion, underlying infection, depression, cardiac and 
pulmonary disease, sleep problem, all can cause fatigue. You have also 
mentioned that you were prescribed sleeping tablets. Sometimes these 
medication may cause disturbances in sleep architecture and tiredness on 
withdrawal as part of its rebound effect. The initial management of fatigue 
would be lifestyle modifications, eliminating anxiety, de-stressing, 
regular exercise and a healthy diet. If your experience symptoms of 
breathlessness, chest pain, fever, night sweats or unexplained weight loss, 
you will need to see your doctor to determine an underlying pathology 
causing your fatigue. Your doctor may order a complete blood count, thyroid 
levels, liver and kidney function tests to help in the diagnosis.
