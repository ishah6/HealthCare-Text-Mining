The X rays findings that you mentioned in your question just describe in 
detail the scoliosis type of your daughter, meaning, the curve is toward 
the left (“levoscoliosis), in the lumbar segment (L1-L4), triradiated 
cartilage and Risser are growth markers used in pediatrics to determine the 
bone age of the children and predict the progression of a scoliosis curve. 
Any spinal curve increasing by 1 degree each month (12 per year) during the 
ascendent phase of the puberty is likely to be a progressive curve that 
will require treatment.
