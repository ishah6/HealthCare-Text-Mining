The surgical procedure known as Rhinoplasty can be performed for medical 
reasons to relieve breathing problems or for cosmetic reasons. The primary 
function of the nose is to breathe efficiently and comfortably, but many 
people have breathing problems with their nose, both during the day and at 
night, at play and at rest. Breathing problems of the nose and sinuses can 
cause headaches, pain, anxiety, and depression, and can interfere with 
participation in many activities. One of the most common reasons for 
noncosmetic nose surgery is a deviated septum. The septum is the vertical 
wall between your two nostrils that extends back into the nasal cavity. 
This wall can be twisted and crooked, and be deviated out of its normal 
position. This deviation results in a smaller nasal passage on one side or 
the other, or even on both. The most common surgery for a deviated septum 
is septoplasty. A septoplasty can straighten a deviated, twisted, bent, or 
crooked septum to improve breathing, reduce the incidence of nasal and 
sinus infections, and increase comfort.
