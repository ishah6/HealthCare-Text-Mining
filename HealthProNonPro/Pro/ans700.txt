It is difficult for me to say whether you are pregnant or not based on your 
symptoms alone. The best way for you to find out is to do a home pregnancy 
test the day you miss your period. However, I do not think that your 
symptoms of lower abdominal pain and leg cramps are related to pregnancy. 
This pain could be due to menstrual cramps or may signify an underlying 
infection. I would suggest that you see your doctor if the pain gets worse 
or if you develop a fever.
