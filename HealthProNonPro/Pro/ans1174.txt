Thank you for your question. It is possible that this rash you have 
sustained could have been due to a skin irritation from the products that 
you used during your sexual activity. Certain spermicidal formulations can 
actually be irritating to the sensitive skin of the vagina. This is 
referred to as contact dermatitis. It can result in redness, itching, or 
even a burning sensation. This rash can become infected if it is left 
untreated. We recommend that you have this area initially examined by your 
general practitioner. This rash may benefit from applying prescription 
topical corticosteroid creams to assist in reducing the inflammation. Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com for your medical question.
