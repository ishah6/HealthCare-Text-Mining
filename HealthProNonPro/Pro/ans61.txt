According to your description, you may be experiencing a cervical nerve 
compression that is producing the neck pain and the numbness in the finger. 
Yes, the osteoporosis may contribute to the degenerative spine changes and 
of course with the pain.In the younger patients, cervical radiculopathy may 
be a result of a disc herniation or an acute injury causing impingement at 
the level where the nerve is leaving the spine. In the older patient, 
cervical radiculopathy is often a result of spinal canal narrowing from 
bone spurs(osteophyte) formation, decreased disc height and degenerative 
changes due to aging process. The treatment strategy usually includes: 
start a physical therapy program aimed to control pain and inflammation, 
and the use of anti-inflammatory medication (“motrin”, “aleve”), also 
re-education of habits and posture to improve quality of life. You also 
should be independent in a stretching and strengthening program and 
continue with these exercises under the periodic supervision of a physical 
therapist initially and then completely on your own. If your condition 
fails to improve with a comprehensive rehabilitation program and selective 
injections, you may be considering a re-evaluation by a Orthopedic surgeon 
to explore other treatment options more aggressive.
