For me, it is swimming. When I start doing my laps, my brain feels like a disaster zone; full of tumbling fears and screaming questions. After the first three laps, a lot of those intruders have fallen out and drowned. Towards the end of my routine, only 2 or 3 of the most important issues are left tumbling around. And when I have finished, they are all in their right place, sorted out and prioritized and all the clutter is left in the pool. Wish I had my own pool!
