Your symptoms of vaginal burning and strong urine smell could indicate an 
underlying infection. It could be caused by a urinary tract infection or 
bacterial vaginosis. You will need to be examined by your doctor and take 
adequate treatment. Your doctor may advise a urinalysis and vaginal swab to 
help determine the cause of infection.
