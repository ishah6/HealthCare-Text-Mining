In my opinion your mother is suffering from aphthous ulcers (aphthae, or 
canker sores). These present as painful oral lesions that appear as 
localized, shallow, round, to oval ulcers with a grayish base. The 
pathogenesis of aphthous ulcers is not well defined. Alterations in local 
cell mediated immunity may be important in the pathogenesis of recurrent 
aphthous stomatitis.Factors that may predispose to the development of recurrent aphthous 
stomatitis include stress (emotional and physical), hormonal factors, 
infections, food hypersensitivity, immuno-suppression, and familial 
tendency. It may also be seen in patients with celiac disease, inflammatory 
bowel disease and vitamin and mineral deficiencies (vitamin B, iron, folic 
and zinc). The most common treatment for aphthous ulcers includes 
symptomatic relief with agents such as triamcinolone, fluocinonide gel, 
amlexanox oral paste and topical analgesics. However, further evaluation by 
your mother's doctor may be required for a definitive diagnosis and 
treatment.
