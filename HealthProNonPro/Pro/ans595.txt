If is difficult to say whether you need antibiotics without a urinalysis. I 
suggest that if your symptoms are getting worse and if you develop a fever, 
go to a doctor right away to do a urinalysis and take appropriate 
antibiotics. Drinking lots of water and cranberry juice will certainly help 
in relieving some symptoms of urinary infection.
