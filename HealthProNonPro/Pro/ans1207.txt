Thank you for your question. Pulmonary tuberculosis produces pus filled 
granulomas within the lung tissue which can spread to other areas of the 
lungs. It is possible that one such granuloma was visualized on your x ray. 
It was perhaps noted to be radiographically stable because it showed no 
indication of rupture or spread to other areas of the lungs. Since we do 
not have access to these x rays, we can only hypothesize that this may be 
the case. For further clarification, please consult your doctor.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
