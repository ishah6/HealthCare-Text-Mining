I tend to agree that with your symptoms and due to the fact that the ocps 
regularised your periods there is strong possibility that you may have 
PCOS. It is possible to be diagnosed with PCOS without the ovarian cysts. 
The important factor is to rule out other causes that lead to menstrual 
irregularities including hyperandrogenism caused by adrenal and ovarian 
tumors. You may need to consult your doctor on further tests including 
levels of androgens in the blood, FSH and LH levels and CT and MRI studies 
to visualize the ovaries and adrenals.
