Anything.  Over 300 isnt good.  I would say the average is around 130.  But it also depends on if you are a male or female.  And weight is not what you should pay attention to.  This is because muscle weights more than fat.  Also because fat is needed for your body to maintain some bodily functions.  If you really want to know if you are at an unhealthy proportion of fat, ask a doctor.
