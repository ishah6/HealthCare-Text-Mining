Itching or pruritus is a common symptom that may be associated with a 
specific dermatologic condition or a systemic disease. There could be many 
causes of itching, however since you've mentioned that the itching 
generally occurs at night, I would definitely try to rule out scabies 
infection.Scabies is caused by the mite Sarcoptes scabiei, which lays its eggs in the 
epidermal layer of human skin. The characteristic itching is worse at 
night. Topical permethrin 5% cream and oral ivermectin are treatment of 
choice in scabies. Antihistamines can help control itching which may 
persist even after successful treatment because of the hypersensitivity 
reaction to mites.Because scabies is transmitted by close or skin-to-skin contact, usual 
recommendations are that all members of the family and close contacts be 
treated at the same time to avoid an endless chain of cross contamination 
and re-infestation. Clothing, linens, stuffed animals should be machined 
washed in hot water and then ironed or dried in a hot dryer.
