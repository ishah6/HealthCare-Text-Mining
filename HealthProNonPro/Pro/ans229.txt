DHEA (dehydroepiandrosterone) is an hormone that is produced by the adrenal 
gland. DHEA is converted to testosterone and estrogen in the body. Side 
effects of the drug may include fatigue, nasal congestion, headache, acne, 
or rapid/irregular heartbeats. The symptoms that you are experiencing may 
be due to the drug but it important to rule out other causes such as 
meningitis which may cause similar symptoms. I would advise you to see your 
doctor for further evaluation and tests. I wish you well, take care.
