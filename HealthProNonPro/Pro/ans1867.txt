Your tongue lesion could be an indication of oral thrush/candidiasis or or 
could be caused by a benign condition known as geographic tongue which is 
seen in 3% of the population. I would advise you to consult with your 
doctor. Microscopical examination from scraping of the tongue could give 
evidence to oral thrush for which an anti-fungal is needed. No medical 
treatment is required for geographic tongue.
