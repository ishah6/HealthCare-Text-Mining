Acute bacterial conjunctivitis usually resolves within 2 to 5 days. The use 
of broad-spectrum topical antibiotics increases the rate of early clinical 
remission. If your symptoms do not resolve within 1 week, I would advise 
you to discontinue the topical treatment and consult your doctor to 
appropriate tests and medication.
