It is difficult for me to say exactly what is the cause of your abdominal 
pain because of the unspecific nature of your history. Stomach pain and 
increased flatus could be due to multiple causes. The most probable causes 
could be gastritis, gall bladder stone or appendicitis (depending on the 
location of the pain). You have also mentioned that you have asthma, 
sometimes chest infections may present with abdominal pain which aggravates 
when you take deep breaths. I would advise that you get yourself examined 
by a doctor. You may be required to do an abdominal ultrasound, urinalysis, 
chest x-ray and a GI endoscopy to further determine the cause of the 
abdominal pain.
