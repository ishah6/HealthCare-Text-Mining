Ok, here is my answer. If you think this guy is a possible life partner, you better start re-thinking it. As you have shown, he drinks, a lot. Alcohol is proven to affect sexual performance, as you have proven here. It sounds like you have a guy who really likes to drink, and who is not attentive to facts (due to alcohol). This guy has bigger problems in that he is taking his anger out on you when the fact is it is his fault. Id say let him threaten leaving, but you leave instead.
