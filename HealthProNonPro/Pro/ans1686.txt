Uterine fibroids are noncancerous growths of the uterus that often appear 
during childbearing years. Fibroids usually don't interfere with conception 
and pregnancy. However, it's possible that the fibroid in the lower uterine 
segment could interfere with the passage of sperm from the cervix to 
fallopian tubes also some fibroids may prevent implantation and growth of 
an embryo, and in these cases, doctors often recommend removing these 
fibroids before attempting pregnancy.
