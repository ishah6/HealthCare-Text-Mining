Hi I wouldnt do it cause if you start you might not be able to stop. Then you will end up getting use to it that you find yourself not enjoying it cause the effect is no longer the same as the beginning. Then you might want to go into something else (another type of drug). Im only telling you this cause my oldest brother went through all that and he is now serving time cause he was dirty and f***ed up hes probation . Thats because he was really good in school with great grades, played sports, choir, and band  and so forth . Its really bad how you land towards the end ... Hope that this helps in making your decision. Good Luck and God bless you in all you do !!!!
