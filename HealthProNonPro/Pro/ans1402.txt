The most common type of headache is a tension type or stress headache. When 
a cause of a headache cannot be found, it is termed primary headaches. 
Migraine, cluster, tension, and rebound headaches are types of primary 
headache. Secondary headaches are caused by underlying structural or 
organic disease. Since your headache is longstanding, I would suggest that you see your 
doctor for further evaluation. Blood-work, CT scan of the brain may be 
needed to rule out any underlying pathological problem.
