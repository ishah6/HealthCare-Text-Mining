Your swollen vein could be a varicose vein which is formed when the valves 
in the veins become defective leading to an abnormal collection of blood. 
Though the cause of varicose veins are not known, it may occur due to a 
congenital deformity of the valve, inflammation of the vessel or prolonged 
standing.You will need to consult your doctor for a duplex ultrasound of the leg to 
determine the presence of varicose veins.Treatment is usually conservative with compression stockings and avoiding 
standing for long periods of time. Severe cases of varicose may even 
require surgery called "vein stripping", sclerotherapy and laser ablation.
