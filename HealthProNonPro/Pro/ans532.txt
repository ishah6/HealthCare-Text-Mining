I do understand your concern. What you are experiencing is menorrhagia, the 
medical term for menstrual periods in which bleeding is abnormally heavy or 
prolonged. Although heavy menstrual bleeding is a common concern among 
premenopausal women, most women don't experience blood loss severe enough 
to be defined as menorrhagia. If you have very heavy menstrual bleeding, 
talk with your doctor. A number of conditions may cause menorrhagia, common 
causes include: hormonal imbalance, dysfunction of the ovaries, uterine 
fibroids, polyps, adenomyosis, inherited bleeding disorders, thyroid 
problems and rarely uterine cancer. You doctor may do blood tests, PAP 
smear, endometrial biopsy and ultrasound scan based on your history and 
physical examination to determine the cause of the bleeding. I hope that 
answers your question, I wish you well.
