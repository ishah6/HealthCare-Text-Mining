First of all, I lived through the 60s; anyone who did that has either tried pot or been a total outcast.  I didnt use much of it and havent had any for a looong time, almost 30 years (and I enhaled).  So, I have an opinion.
  
We have a law we cant enforce.  That negates the value of having the law.
  
I think tobacco does more physical harm than marajuana.

I spend a lot of time in Amsterdam, in The Netherlands, where pot is legal, and I know a lot of people who smoke it, and I dont know of anyone with a problem because of it (I dont smoke pot there, either).

When people say it leads to other drug use: Lets say somebody goes to his favorite dope dealer (I think they mostly have a cornucopia of illegal stuff to sell) and cant get marajuana, the dealer would just as easily sell something else, "Hey, try this, its all the rage."  Well, thats marketing. Dope dealers are not necessarily stupid.  But they are dope dealers, and community enhancement is not on their schedules.

So, in my opinion, why not legalize it and let the government control and tax it?  That would be fine with people who approve of marajuana use and probably be the best (most practical) option for those opposed.
  
Finally, anyone opposed to the use of marajuana for medicinal purposes should re-think his or her position.  That doesnt make any sense at all.
