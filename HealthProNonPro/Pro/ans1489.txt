The symptoms of pregnancy differ from mother to mother. Up to 70 percent of 
expectant mothers have nausea, sometimes with vomiting, early in pregnancy. 
This is usually do to the increase in the levels of pregnancy hormones 
(beta HCG). These symptoms generally improve by the 13th - 14th week of 
pregnancy. You may need to call your doctor to make sure that the pregnancy 
is carrying on normally.
