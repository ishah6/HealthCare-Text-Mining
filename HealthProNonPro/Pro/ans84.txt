All pain killer medications are metabolized in the liver and long term use 
may cause certain amount of liver damage. The risk of liver damage depends 
on pre-existing liver diseases, dosage of the drugs and concurrent use of 
alcohol. As for your hepatic cyst, it is relatively small in size. No 
medical therapy has proven effective in reducing the size of simple hepatic 
cysts. If you do not have any symptoms, I would advise you to wait and 
watch.
