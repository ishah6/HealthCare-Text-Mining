Development of male breast is termed gynaecomastia. This condition is 
fairly common during adolescence due to imbalances between male and female 
hormone levels resulting in a temporary state in which certain hormones 
that are more predominant in females may rise more than male hormone levels 
leading to breast enlargement or gynecomastia. Gynecomastia due to such 
cause may be transient and usually corrects itself within six months to two 
years with further hormone stabilization. Pharmacological treatment is with 
a drug called clomiphene and tamoxifen used for recent-onset and tender 
gynecomastia. Before treatment of gynecomastia is begun, it is very 
important to rule out any underlying pathoogical cause. Consultation with 
your doctor and additional tests may be required before treatment is begun.
