Severe pain and a sore throat after tonsillectomy make it difficult to 
swallow. Though milk and dairy products are generally avoided post surgery 
(due to chances of nausea and vomiting, as a side-effect of anesthesia and 
pain medication), ice cream can be taken. This helps to ease the pain and 
swelling. Other similar food that you can take include frozen pops, fruit 
juices, popsicles, jello, mashed potatoes and soft pasta.
