Menopause is associated with a variety of symptoms ranging from hot 
flashes and vaginal dryness, to a reduction in bone mineral density. While 
estrogen has traditionally been used in managing many of these issues, it 
has also been shown to be dangerous in women who smoke as it may increase 
the risk for blood clots. However, evidence is emerging that 
progesterone alone is effective in providing relief from hot flashes, 
vaginal symptoms (such as dryness and itching), and may also help retain 
bone mineral density. Additionally, there are many other alternative 
therapeutic options to help manage specific symptoms associated with 
menopause. As such, it is reasonable to persue progesterone at first, and 
see how it works for you. If your symptoms are not appropriately managed, 
then it would be approriate to explore other, more specific treatment 
options.
