I do understand that you are concerned due to your symptoms. Though there 
could be several reasons for your symptoms, I have calculated your BMI to 
be 18.5 which indicates that you may be underweight. Being underweight may 
present its own health risks. A diet low in calories makes it difficult to 
get enough of the vitamins, minerals, and other nutrients needed to 
maintain good health. Being underweight can lead to an increased risk of:breathing problemsnot being able to fight infections as easily due to a weakened immune system osteoporosis (weakened bones) reproductive problems stomach problems tuberculosisIf you are underweight, you may have an eating disorder or a health 
condition that is causing a low appetite. I would advise you to talk to 
your doctor to find solutions that will help you reach a healthy weight and 
prevent disease.
