It is possible that the thick white coloured liquid could be pus draining 
from an abscess. I would suggest that you see you surgeon for further 
evaluation and drainage of abscess if required. Also your doctor may need 
to rule out underlying diabetes which could make you susceptible from a 
wound infection. Treatment with antibiotics may be necessary if there is 
presence of a pathogen in the culture. Please refrain from using any 
deodorants until a diagnosis and treatment has been made.
