Usually digestive problems could be due to the lack of fiber in the diet or 
a bacterial/viral infection of the gut. Some recommendations to reduce the 
discomfort of gas are changing diet, taking medicines, and reducing the 
amount of air swallowed. Avoiding sweets , starches and fibers could help 
reducing gas also reduce fat in diet, less fat in the diet helps the 
stomach empty faster, allowing gases to move into the small intestine. Over 
the counter medicine that contains simethicone usually helps, especially 
when combined with the diet previously described. If the problems persist, 
an evaluation with the Gastroenterologist might be needed to rule out other 
possibilities such as enzymes deficiencies, for example lactose intolerance 
in which a deficiency of lactase causes malabsorption milk and derivatives 
causing bloating, gas and other symptoms. I wish you the best.
