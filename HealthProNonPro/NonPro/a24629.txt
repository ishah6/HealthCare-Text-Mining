Its a great place to snow board...kinda scary though.  Im not talking metaphorically either...It really is a great ski resort...

That other stuff...well it causes more damage than cigs...mainly because of the way people take it in <smoke it>.  Bad stuff. Its not addictive like nicoteen, but people do cause way more damage with the stuff.  

Legalize it NO WAY!  Were already overloaded with drunk drivers...We dont need to encourage pot head drivers...


Stick with the skiing and boarding.
