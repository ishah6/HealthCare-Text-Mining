First of all, if you see a deformity in your wrist along with the pain, 
swelling and limitation for the normal movements I recommend you to go to 
the hospital and get X rays done to rule out a possible wrist/hand fracture 
or dislocation produced when you put all your weight on the wrist. If the 
x-rays or other imaging study (CT or MRI) do not show any fracture of hand 
or wrist, then you can think about a post traumatic Tenosynovitis or wrist 
sprain. The healing time varies from patient to patient, but generally 
requires Protection (splinting and avoidance of painful movements and 
activities), Rest, Ice the first 24 hours and then local heat (hot moist 
compresses or paraffin baths), anti-inflammatory medication (i.e.: “Aleve”) 
so you can come back progressively to your daily routine in about 4-6 
weeks. It is recommended that you keep using the wrist brace and avoid 
movements and activities that put additional stress on the wrist.
