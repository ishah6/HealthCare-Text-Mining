I would NOT go to a 24 hour abortion clinic anywhere if I was you.  Abortions are a serious medical procedure and you should carefully plan this.  Who will drive you home?  Know you will feel weak and bleed.  Bring sanitary pads & Advil with you.  You can have depression, plan to take off work.  Also, make sure to visit your doctor after & be checked for infection.  It is not like a pap smear, honey.
