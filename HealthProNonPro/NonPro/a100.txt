Laboratory rats whose diets are supplemented with blueberries have been shown to be healthier in many different respects, but it will take a lot more research to figure out all of the reasons why. 
 
According to Dr Weil, "The anthocyanins they contain (the pigments that make them blue) are potent antioxidants."  Of course these days "contains potent antioxidants" often means "we have no idea how it works."  We found out a long time ago that many healthy fresh foods contain vitamin C, which truly enough is healthy because its a "potent antioxidant," but that didnt mean that we had the whole story.  Fresh fruits are still (demonstrably) better for you than taking a vitamin C pill, and a lot of research is being done to figure out why thats so.  Every time they find something that might play a role, they give it a fancy name like "anthocyanins" or "bioflavonoids," but nobody knows how many fancy names stand between us and truly unlocking the mystery of blueberries. 
 
That means that, for now, theres nothing to do but relax and enjoy what nature made us.
