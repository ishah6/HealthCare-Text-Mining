Incontinence in men could be caused by injury to the spinal cord, 
prostatitis or prostate hypertrophy, urinary tract infections and an over 
active bladder. You will need to see your doctor for further evaluation. A 
complete blood-work, urinalysis, ultrasound of kidney and pelvis and CT 
scan may be required to determine the cause of incontinence. Treatment will 
depend on the cause of incontinence.
