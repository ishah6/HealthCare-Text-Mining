It is not likely that the blackout episodes are related to the Ankylosisn 
Spondylitis. Blackouts are periods of unconsciousness or memory loss. 
Generally, a blackout is described as a period of unconsciousness or lack 
of awareness when you are unable to recall what happened or what you did. 
Blackouts may occur as a result of brain damage, drug side effects, or 
disorders affecting brain function, such as epilepsy. The potential 
complications of blackouts depend on the underlying cause. Because 
blackouts can be due to serious diseases, failure to seek treatment can 
result in serious complications and permanent damage. Once the underlying 
cause is diagnosed, it is important for you to follow the treatment plan 
that you and your health care professional design specifically for you to 
reduce the risk of potential complications.
