Smokers have a higher incidence of lower respiratory tract infection. Also 
the smoke may cause irritation of the oropharyngeal mucosa which may lead 
to the development of sore throat. I would suggest that you see your ENT 
doctor for further evaluation. Your doctor may have to do a laryngoscopy to 
rule out any oropharyngeal tumor.
