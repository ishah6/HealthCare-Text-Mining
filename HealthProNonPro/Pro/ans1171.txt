Thank you for your question. It is possible that these lumps in the area of 
your calves could be varicose veins. Varicose veins are swollen veins that 
are usually develop in the lower extremities. These varicose veins can 
become enlarged over time and very painful. Varicose veins can be treated 
with corticosteroid injections to reduce the inflammation and in the most 
severe cases, they can be surgically removed. It would be best that you 
follow up with your doctor in order to be assessed to see if you have 
varicose veins and to determine what will be the best treatment option for 
you.
