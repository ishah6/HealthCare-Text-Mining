The ulnar nerve is an extension of the medial cord of the brachial plexus. 
This is a mixed nerve that supplies innervation to muscles in the forearm 
and hand and provides sensation over the medial half of the fourth and the 
entire fifth digit of the hand, the ulnar part of the palm, and the ulnar 
portion of the posterior aspect of the hand. In your case due to the 
operation and the calcifications the nerve was affected and is giving you 
the symptoms that you described. Occupational therapy and work hardening 
programs are beneficial. Therapists may use and design splints to restrict 
the range of joint motion and cushions to ameliorate the effects of 
pressure. Use of a night splint is a common occupational or physical 
therapy technique that aims to limit the flexion and extension of the elbow 
at night. Therapists also use nerve gliding, sliding, or tensioning 
exercises which seek to promote smoother movements of the nerve within the 
cubital tunnel and to reduce adhesions and other causes of physical nerve 
compression. Typically, nerves regenerate at a rate of 1 mm/day. In some 
cases, regeneration is accompanied by pain and paresthesias, however,a 
favorable surgical outcome is more likely for sensory function than for 
motor function; and, overall, a favorable outcome occurs in 85-95% of 
cases. In the meantime, try to be patient, manage the pain, if any, with 
ant-inflammatory medication and do a consistent PT and OT program.
