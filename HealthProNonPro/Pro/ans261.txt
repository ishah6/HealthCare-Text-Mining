Emergency contraception prevents pregnancy after sex has occurred. They 
work by changing a woman's hormone levels. This prevents pregnancy by 
inhibiting ovulation or by disrupting egg and sperm transport, 
fertilization, or implantation. Emergency contraceptive pills are not as 
effective as other contraceptive methods.I do understand your concern for pregnancy due to the delayed period. If 
your next period after taking this medicine is more than seven days late, 
or is abnormal in any way, I would suggest that you do a urine pregnancy 
test to see if the missed period is due to pregnancy.
