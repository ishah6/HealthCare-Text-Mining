This is a treatment that is currently outside of the medical mainstream and is not supported by double blind randomized trials looking at five year survival rates (probably the gold standard test for a treatment program).  That said, to my knowledge, it has not been disproven either.  

I am fairly certain the cure rates you are citing  are misleading.  As to the Nobel prize, I am not aware of any prize being awarded on the topic of C-C treatment (or, for that matter, to the primary advocates or inventors of the treatment).

Still it is an interesting treatment concept -- those considering such a treatment should consult with a doctor though to be sure that certain side effects are avoided.
