The most probable reason for your symptoms is due to a clogged eustachian 
tube due to the infection. The eustachian tube connects the inner ear to 
the back of the throat and if this gets blocked, pressure develops inside 
the ear cavity leading to the symptoms of ear discomfort. the treatment 
that your doctor has advised is appropriate for the infection. You will 
find your symptoms improving within 7 to 10 days. If your symptoms don`t 
improve within this time frame, see your doctor for further evaluation.
