I understand your concern about possible yeast infection. Treatment of 
vaginal yeast infection includes over-the-counter vaginal cream or 
suppository, like monistat, vagistat, canesten etc. Before using the 
treatment, make sure that you indeed have yeast but, none other infection. 
You may visit a walk in clinic for an examination and identification of the 
type of infection. Symptoms of yeast infection include itching, burning, 
pain during urination and vaginal discharge which is odorless and typically 
has a whitish, thick appearance and texture, like cottage cheese. I hope 
the information helps, take care.
