Vegetable smoothies are excellent in diabetes control. Taking this diet 
requires you to replace one of your meal with a vegetable smoothie. Try to 
avoid adding cauliflower, brussels sprouts, broccoli and kale in your 
vegetable smoothies. These vegetables are better for you when eaten cooked. 
Also avoid adding any high calorie protein supplement to the smoothie.
