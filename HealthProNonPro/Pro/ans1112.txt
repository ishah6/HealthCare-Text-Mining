Thank you for question. It is possible that your are simply experiencing 
dryness of the tissue around the nipple. This is very common and can be 
treated by lightly exfoliating the area with a damp wash cloth. After this, 
you can apply hypoallergenic, fragrance free lotion to prevent future 
cracking. After your child is born, and if you are going to breastfeed, we 
do not recommend using any products on your nipple area as it may be 
irritating to the baby.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
