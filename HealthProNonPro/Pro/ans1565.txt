There could be multiple cause of post coital bleeding. Bleeding could be 
due to a cervical lesion, an infection of the cervix (cervicitis), polyp 
and bleeding from the lining of the uterus. Since you have had frequent 
symptoms of bleeding, I would advise that you see your OBGyn for a full 
workup. Until a work up has been done, I would suggest that bleeding after 
sex is not a symptom to be ignored.
