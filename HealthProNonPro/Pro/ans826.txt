Lipoden injections helps in weight loss by directly affecting the body's 
metabolism. The possible side effects of the drug include nausea, vomiting, 
loose stools and increased urination. There has been no study that shows 
lipoden shots reduce the effectiveness of birth control pills. I would 
recommend that you consult a bariatrician for further information.
