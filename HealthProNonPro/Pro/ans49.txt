According to your description it seems that you are going through a lot of 
stress and this might be the cause for your pains. Muscle tension is a 
common symptom of stress and anxiety. There are many effects of the stress 
on the body. Muscle stress can be something that comes and goes, or it can 
be a debilitating and chronic burden on the body and mind. Muscle tension 
is one of the many physical symptoms of anxiety and stress. Muscle tension 
can be caused by a number of symptoms. Staying in the same position for a 
long period of time, whether it be in front of the computer or at work, can 
trigger tension to build up in the muscles. Not exercising and not 
stretching can bring an increased burden of stress into the muscles. 
Physically demanding occupations, poor body posture, stress, anxiety, and 
repetitive motions can also contribute to causing tension. Experiencing 
high levels of anxiety will lower your productivity levels at school and 
make you feel unhappy in life. Stressed out people many times do not even 
know it until they have reached burnout. Burnout causes you to make 
decisions you normally wouldn't make such as quit your courses. When you 
feel burned out, the best thing to do is take a break. Removing yourself 
from a difficult situation will give you a chance to figure things out and 
return to it with a new perspective and energy to handle it much more 
effectively.
