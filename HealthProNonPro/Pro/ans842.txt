Many parents are concerned when their child does not eat properly. 
Reviewing what you have written, your son is most probably having a 
selective eating disorder. It is often seen that children with this 
disorder prefer to consume only certain types of food. The problem could 
have developed from an incident like choking or gaging during a meal.This 
condition is benign and will usually phase out as the child grows up.The constipation as the result of the picky eating can be treated with 
fecal disimpaction by enemas. Once the colon has been evacuated, chronic 
laxative therapy is generally required. Any pediatric laxative can be used 
as long as it is used in sufficient quantity to produce 1-2 soft stools 
daily. Long-term success in the management of constipation depends on the 
child establishing regular and routine toilet times. It is recommended that 
the child be encouraged to attend the toilet twice daily for 5-10 minutes, 
preferably after breakfast and supper.
