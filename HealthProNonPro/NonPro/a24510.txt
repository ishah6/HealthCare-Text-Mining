This may sound funny... it looks funny too but it works. Go to Walmart (and I say walmart cuz its cheaper) and buy some face lifting lotion for ur face. Rub it on ur chin, and neck b4 bed. Get a long tube sock and tie it around ur head from top of head to under chin and tie it. make the knot at the top of ur head so u dont choke in ur sleep. Do this for about 1-2 weeks. It will give u a face lift and get rid of that extra flabby skin.
