Thank you for your question. Seizures are a rare neurological side effect 
of taking risperidone (Risdone). However, without a neurological exam, 
blood tests, and diagnostic imaging studies we cannot be certain that he 
has developed a seizure disorder, or if this is indeed due to a side effect 
of the medication. Since the seizures are continuing despite the fact that 
he is on anti-epileptic medication, we recommend that you consider taking 
him to a neurologist to be expertly diagnosed. We do not advise you to 
discontinue any of the medications until speaking to the physician who 
prescribed this medication to him. AskTheDoctor.com wishes your brother a rapid recovery.
