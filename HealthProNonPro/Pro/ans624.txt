In most cases, abdominal pain is not serious and it gets better without 
treatment. Abdominal pain that cannot be explained after a thorough 
physical examination and appropriate further tests is known as functional 
abdominal pain. Functional abdominal pain is one of the most common 
complaints of children. Although the exact cause is not known, nerve 
signals or chemicals secreted by the gut or brain, may cause the gut to be 
more sensitive. Constipation, lactose intolerance, infections, IBD, celiac 
disease, and food allergies may also cause pain abdomen in children.I would advise you to consult with your child's doctor. If a specific cause 
for abdominal pain is discovered during the evaluation, the physician will 
discuss specific management of the condition. Your child may benefit from 
certain dietary changes depending on her history. I would advise avoidance 
of greasy and spicy foods, caffeine, juices, and carbonated drinks. 
Eliminating lactose from the diet may benefit those who suffer from lactose 
intolerance in addition to functional abdominal pain. In addition, fruit 
drinks, sugar-free chewing gum, and sugar free candy sweetened with 
sorbitol should be avoided. If your daughter does not respond to any of 
these treatments, she may benefit from low doses of tricyclic 
antidepressants.
