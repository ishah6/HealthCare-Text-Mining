Either a tendinitis or a bursitis of the hip may produce those symptoms 
that you described.I suggest treat it as any tendinitis, meaning: avoid 
activities that exacerbate the pain, apply ice locally during the early 
phase and moist heat during the long-term phase. Use of anti-inflammatory 
medication NSAIDs (“aleve”, “motrin”) can help to ease pain and swelling. 
The healing time is different for each individual in particular, but if you 
see no improvement over 2-4 weeks with these conservative measures, I 
strongly recommend a reevaluation to rule out some other conditions or 
factors that may be causing your symptoms.
