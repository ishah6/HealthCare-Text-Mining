No mental illness can be fixed but they all have treatment that can lessen or deminish your symptoms... 

Best thing to do is check with your insurance co. and see if mental illness is covered and if so ask them to advise you of which docs in your area are covered....

Start seeing a therapist and they wil tell you if meds are a good and effective treatment for what you have...

Good luck. If you need support please go to the following link
