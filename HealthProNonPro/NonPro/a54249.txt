Coffee may have bad effects during a fast. Also coffee addicts cant be happy. So give it up during fast. Dont believe all those who have never done it. At the top of this webpage you see a medical doctor saying you can go about a month before it becomes starving which can kill  you.

But wait! That is not the end of it. The next MD says you should fast when you are depressed!!!  4 more MDs talk about it. Bible has 74 references to fasting. In it aposle Luke says " I fast twice a week." 

Then there are even a page on how diet affects depression-- "Natural Healing." Then see "Prescription for Life" for how to be happier by top psychologists and religion. It has the secret of life.
