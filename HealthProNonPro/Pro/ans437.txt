I do understand your concern for being underweight. Your ideal weight for 
your height should be around 55-58 kg. Being extremely thin has it's own 
concerns. Those who are extremely lean tend to have weaker immune systems, 
making them prone to infections, surgical complications, and slower 
recovery times for illness. They tend to have low muscle mass, and less 
than ideal hair, teeth, and skin. They may have disruptions in the ability 
to regulate hormones and protect bone health, and women could become unable 
to menstruate.You can definitely try endura mass, but the results may not be guaranteed. 
Other healthy ways of gaining weight are :i) Have a healthy balanced meal consistinf of 60-70% carbohydrates, 10-15% 
proteins and a small amount of fat. Eat foor higher in calories and 
minerals rather than food with high fat content.ii) Try to pack in more calories per serving. Adding cooked eggs, shredded 
chicken to your meal will add these extra calories.iii) Do not take beverages/juices before and after meals.iv) Consume small amounts of avocado, dried nuts, olives or salmon which 
are good fat sources.v) Snack in between meal times, dried fruits/yogurt are good choices.I hope you will find the information useful, take care.
