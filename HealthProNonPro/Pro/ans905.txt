Most loose motions in infants are caused by viral infection. As long as the 
baby is happy and active, feeding properly, it may not be concerning. 
However, if the green colour of her stools and the habit of passing motions 
3 to 5 times a day is different from what she normally has, she needs to be 
examined by her doctor to rule out any problems.
