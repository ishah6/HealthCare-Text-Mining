Dont desensitize yourself to everything that happened through alcohol.  Take time to right the wrong decisions that you made once youve done that, youll feel nice having solved them urself.  Reconcile with your old friends relatives or parents that you havent seen in a long time.  Youll feel great after you go back to your roots.
