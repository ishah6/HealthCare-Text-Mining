HCG is a pregnancy hormone which is produced by the placenta. HCG hormones 
can also be used as part of a diet plan in order to lose weight. The HCG 
diet which includes hCG in drops usually involves a low calorie diet as 
well as daily doses of HCG drops. Pregnancy can affect the use of HCG drops 
and I would not recommended using HCG drops or injections if you are 
pregnant. You may have to use birth control to prevent pregnancy 
effectively when you take hCG drops. I hope this helps, take care.
