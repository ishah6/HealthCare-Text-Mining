The lump in the groin could be due to a swollen lymph node. Typically lymph 
nodes get enlarged when there is a nearby infection in this case a groin or 
a urinary tract infection. I would advice you to keep a watch on it for a 
few days. You may require antibiotics if there is an underlying infection.
