Thank you for your question. It is possible that your doctor determined 
your vaginal infection could have been due to a bacterial infection. 
Satranidazole (Satrogyl -O) will not treat a fungal yeast (candida) 
infection and you will need to be prescribed a course of oral anti-fungal 
medication along with vaginal suppositories to treat this yeast infection. 
Please follow up with your doctor to be prescribed a course of anti-fungal 
medication to treat this infection.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
