Studies have found that a low carb diet (under 20 grams a day) produced 
significant reduction in liver fat. Though this study was done for a small 
group and may need further confirmation, it appears that a very-low-carb 
diet may be one of the best dietary approaches to fatty liver disease. I 
would suggest that you consult with a nutritionist on various options 
available eg. Ketogenic Mediterranean Diet. I hope this helps, take care.
