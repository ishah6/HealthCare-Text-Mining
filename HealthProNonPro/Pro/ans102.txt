Anal tags are usually found associated with a variety of anorectal 
problems. These may occur as a result of a previous insult or injury such 
as anal fissures. Anal tags are usually asymptomatic and can be left alone. 
If the anal skin tag is causing symptoms, the tag can be excised by a 
surgeon/doctor. Banding will not help in the removal of the anal tag.
