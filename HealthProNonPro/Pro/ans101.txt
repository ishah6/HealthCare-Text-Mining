An ovarian cyst is a fluid filled sac in the ovary. Ovarian cysts are 
relatively common, affecting 7-10% of women. These cysts can cause pelvic 
discomfort and pain, dysmenorrhea, menorrhagia and abdominal distension.Since you've had a kidney tumor removed, it is important to investigate for 
an underlying malignant cause of the ovarian cyst.Many patients with simple ovarian cyst smaller than 5cm and normal CA125 
levels require only observation and serial ultrasonographic examination. 
Cysts larger than 5 cm presenting with symptoms should be considered for 
surgery. You may also need to consult a oncologist if the CA125 level is 
above 35 U/ml and if there is a history of ovarian cancer in the family.
