It seems to me that your mum is suffering from a migraine headache. Since 
you've mentioned that pain medication does not suit her due to ulcers, I 
would suggest certain alternatives.i) Keep a headache diary : An accurate diary should indicate the days your 
mum had a headache and the severity of the headache. It should also 
include very accurate details on diet, sleep patters, stress patterns and 
weather patterns that day.ii) Your mum needs to avoid all factors that induce migraine attack, 
including lack of sleep, hunger, fatigue, stress, certain foods etc.iii) Lifestyle modification : De-stress with yoga and exercise and take a 
healthy balanced diet. Avoid coffee, alcohol and chocolates.iv) Medication : sumatriptan, propranolol, valproic acid, and topiramate 
may help control the symptoms as well as reduce the frequency. These are 
available only through a doctor’s prescription. I wish your mum well, take 
care.
