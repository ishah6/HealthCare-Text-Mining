Thank you for your question. The acxion/fentermina 30mg contains a 
medication called phentermine, which is a psycho-stimulant appetite 
suppressant that is used for weight loss. Although this medication does not 
directly interact with metformin however, as you lose weight, your 
metformin dosage may be adjusted. For this reason we recommend that you 
inform your doctor about using phentermine while you are on metformin, to 
make sure you are at a therapeutic dosage for treatment of your ovarian 
cysts.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
