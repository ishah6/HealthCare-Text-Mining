The headaches, dizziness and tiredness may be due to an underlying viral 
flu and may not necessarily be a result of the the antibiotic. You can try 
over the counter medication like tylenol. I would also advice adequate 
rest. If these do not help, you may need to consult your doctor to rule out 
a sinus headache and prescribe appropriate antibiotics for the infection.
