Try the approach suggested by the Vietnamese Buddhist monk, Thich Nhat Hanh (who now has a spiritual center in France having been exiled by the Communist regime in his homeland).  He urges all to be completely aware of and to focus on the "present moment."  Dont let the burdens of the past or worries about the future control your emotions.  Sit down and relax as best as you can.  Then take a deep breath, saying to yourself:  "Breathing in, I calm my body."  Then exhaling say: "Breathing out, I smile." Continuing to take deep breaths say: "Dwelling in this present moment, I know that it is a wonderful moment."
