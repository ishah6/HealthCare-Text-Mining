Though women are at greater risk for developing urinary tract infections, 
frequent UTIs and cystitis is a concern and needs to be investigated. There 
are many causes of cystitis and it is difficult for me to comment what 
could be the cause in your daughter's case.I would recommend that your daughter follow all hygiene routines like 
wiping from front to back, avoiding vaginal douches and soaps or perfume in 
the genitalia. Your daughter may need to consult a urologist. Her doctor 
may perform a cystoscopy to help determine the cause of frequent cystitis.
