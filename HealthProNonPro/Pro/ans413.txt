I do understand that you may be concerned about your digestive problems. 
After reviewing your symptoms, it may be possible that your are suffering 
from an acid reflux disease. This is causes due to the increased gastric 
acids that enter the esophagus due to the weak muscles in the esophagus. 
Although you may need to consult your doctor to rule out other causes 
including gastroparesis and irritable bowel syndrome.The measures that you can take to relieve the symptoms are :i) Eat plenty of fruits and leafy vegetables.ii) Avoid fatty and spicy meals.iii) Avoid excessive tea and coffeeiv) Avoid lying down within 2 hours of a meal.Milk does not have any beneficial action on digestion and may in-fact cause 
indigestion in certain cases.
