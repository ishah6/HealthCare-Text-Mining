I do understand your concern. It's possible to have cervicitis and not 
experience any signs or symptoms. Often, cervicitis results from a sexually 
transmitted infection, but can develop from noninfectious causes, too. An 
allergy, either to contraceptive spermicides or to latex in condoms or an 
overgrowth of bacteria in the vagina (bacterial vaginosis) also can lead to 
cervicitis. Successful treatment of cervicitis involves treating the 
underlying cause of the inflammation.
