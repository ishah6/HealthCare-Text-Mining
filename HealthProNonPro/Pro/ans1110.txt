Thank you for consulting us. There is indeed an associated risk of kidney 
damage with shock wave lithotripsy. It is important that your urologist 
assess your kidney function prior to performing this procedure again. There 
is no specific amount of times that lithotripsy can be performed but it 
your candidacy for this procedure rests on your kidney function, the size 
of the kidney stones, and your current existing medical conditions.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
