Difficult in swallowing and breathing could certainly be due to the thyroid 
nodule. Most patients experience difficulty swallowing, a feeling of 
fullness, pain or pressure in the neck, a hoarse voice, or neck tenderness. 
I would suggest that you consult an endocrinologist for further evaluation 
and work-up. I hope this helps, take care.
