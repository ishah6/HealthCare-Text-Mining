Seborrheic dermatitis is an inflammatory skin condition that causes scaly 
and itchy skin of the scalp. It may also affect the face, upper chest and 
back. There are many factors that lead to the condition : Infection by 
malassezia (a fungus), immunosuppressive diseases like HIV/AIDS, change of 
seasons and stress and fatigue.Diagnosis is made by history and skin biopsy in certain cases. Seborrheic 
dermatitis tends to be a chronic condition. The treatment involves the 
early control of flares and reducing excoriations.In my opinion a short-term use of topical corticosteroid may help to reduce 
the inflammation and itching. Sytemic ketoconazole/fluconazole or a 
combination with corticosteroids is also recommended in severe and 
unresponsive cases.You may also follow certain measures at home :i) Wash hair with anti-dandruff shampooii) Avoid harsh soaps or creamiii) Avoid scratching whenever possibleiv) Wear smooth textured cotton clothing.
