It is difficult for me to comment on the cause of your abdominal pain. 
Though it could be the result of your kidney stones or urinary tract 
infection, I would advise that you see your doctor for examination, blood 
work and imaging studies (ultrasound) to determine the cause of the pain. 
Take care
