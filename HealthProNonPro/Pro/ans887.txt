Most cases of fracture of clavicle are managed conservatively. A fracture 
that is present in the distal 1/3 is more prone to non-union of the joint. 
Usually a fractured clavicle takes 6-8 weeks to heal. Since it's been 11 
months in your case, I would suggest that you see your doctor to rule out a 
non-union of the joint.
