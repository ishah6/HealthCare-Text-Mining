There is a small chance that an antibiotic may interact with the birth 
control pill and reduce its effectiveness. It is difficult for me to tell 
whether you are pregnant or not. A home pregnancy test will certainly 
confirm pregnancy. It is best to do the test 2 weeks after unprotected sex. 
All the best.
