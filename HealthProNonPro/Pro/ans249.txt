Due to the fact that your grandmother and aunt had history of ovarian and 
breast cancer, there is a small percentage of chance that you could have it 
too. This often seen due to mutation in two genes namely BRCA1 and BRCA2.I would suggest that you talk to your doctor/surgeon to see what is the 
best line of treatment in your case. I hope I could provide some 
information regarding your problem, I wish you well.
