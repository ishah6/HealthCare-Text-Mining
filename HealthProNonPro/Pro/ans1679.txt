Usually most headaches are due to tension type or stress headache. When a 
cause of a headache cannot be found, it is termed primary 
headaches. Migraine, cluster, tension, and rebound headaches are types of 
primary headache. However, in some cases the headaches may be the result of 
an underlying disease. These are termed secondary headaches and are caused 
by underlying structural or organic disease. Since your headache is 
longstanding, I would suggest that you see your doctor for further 
evaluation. Blood-work, CT scan of the brain may be needed to rule out any 
underlying pathological problem.
