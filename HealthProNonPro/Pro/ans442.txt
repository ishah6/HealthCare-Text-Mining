I do understand your concern for IBS and the pain that your are 
experiencing. Inflammatory bowel disease is an idiopathic disease with an 
unknown cause. It sometimes occurs after an infection of the intestines.IBS is a lifelong condition with periods of active disease and remissions. 
The goal in the treatment of IBS is to reduce the symptoms of abdominal 
pain and loose stools..Diet is an important factor in reducing the symptoms of IBS. It is 
important for you to consult your doctor/dietitian in regard to a low 
residue nutritive diet. This will help to relieve symptoms of diarrhea and 
abdominal pain. Stress management is also an important aspect in the 
treatment of IBS.Treatment with drugs usually begins with anticholinergic medications. Your 
doctor may also prescribe anti diarrheal agents, antispasmodics, and acid 
suppressants for symptom relief.
