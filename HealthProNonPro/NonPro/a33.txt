It has been reported that the mortality rate of bird flu is about 50%.  See:

50% mortality rate in ANY disease will cause a lot of fear.  If the bird flu were to become even more easily spread, then youre looking at perhaps millions of people dying.

However, estimating mortality rate isnt this that straightforward.  There is some doubt whether the mortality rate is really that high.  It may be that there are many non-fatal cases that have gone undiagnosed, so that the mortality rate might be much less than 50%.
