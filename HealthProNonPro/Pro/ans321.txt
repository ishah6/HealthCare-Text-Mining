From your symptoms it is most probable that you are suffering from a 
urinary tract infection. The typical symptoms are burning on urination, 
cloudy urine and pain in the abdomen. Also since you are having frequent 
urge to urinate, you may be having bladder cystitis which is inflammation 
of the bladder due to a urinary tract infection. I would advise an analysis 
of your urine and antibiotics in the presence of infection. In the 
meanwhile keep drinking plents of fluids. Cranberry juice is especially 
helpful in these cases to reduce the symptoms of urinary irritation.
