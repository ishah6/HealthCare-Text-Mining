Pain abdomen can be caused by a variety of pathological processes that 
affect the organs in the abdomen. You have mention that you are 
experiencing pain in the upper abdominal region and this might suggest that 
the pain is caused either by gastritis, kidney stones or urinary tract 
infection. If your pain is severe I would suggest going to the ER or 
consulting your doctor for further management and test. Bloodwork, 
urinalysis and imaging studies will help in the diagnosis.
