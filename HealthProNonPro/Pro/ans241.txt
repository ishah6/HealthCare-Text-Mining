Do not worry about the scoliosis because this will not progress at your 
mother’s age. She has a Spina bifida, which a broad term that may be used 
to describe a number of open defects of the spinal column of various 
degrees of severity in affecting nervous functions, apparently is 
asymptomatic in your mother. The osteophytes (bony spurs) are sign of 
degenerative bone changes (spondylosis) which is aggravated by the narrowed 
disc space L4-L5 that is producing a nerve compression that is causing the 
back pain.
