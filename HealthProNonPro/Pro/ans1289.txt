Thank you for your question. You may engage in sexual activity up to 24 
hours prior your surgery unless otherwise specified by your surgeon. After 
surgery, it is recommend that you avoid sexual activity for about 3-4 weeks 
while your incision heals. This will prevent any accidental disturbance or 
injury to the incision or sutures. Please be guided accordingly.
