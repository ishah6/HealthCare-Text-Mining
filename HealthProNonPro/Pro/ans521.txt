I do understand your concern. Since you've restarted on a new cycle of 
pill, I would advise that you use additional birth control method (condoms) 
till upto the last 7 days of the pill. However, from a practical stand 
point, it is safer to assume that full protection will not begin till one 
full pack is completed.
