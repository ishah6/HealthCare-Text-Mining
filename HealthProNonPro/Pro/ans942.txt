Oral cancer will usually present as a sore that does not heal, a lump or 
thickening of the skin, reddish or whitish patch inside the mouth, pain and 
stiffness of the jaw, sore throat and difficulty in chewing or swallowing. 
From your symptoms, it is unlikely that you have oral cancer and your 
symptoms could be caused either due to folliculitis or acne. If you have 
acne, topical or systemic antibiotics, retinoids (creams or orally) will be 
beneficial.
