Your husband is probably suffering form pharyngitis. This is caused due to 
inflammation of the pharynx by a viral or bacterial infection. Most sore 
throats are caused by viruses and needs no additional treatment. However 
since your husband has difficulty in breathing, I would suggest that he 
visit his doctor for further evaluation. He may require a throat swab and a 
chest x-ray. Antibiotics may be required in the presence of a bacterial 
infection.
