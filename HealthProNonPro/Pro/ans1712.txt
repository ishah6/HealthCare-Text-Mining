Weight loss in a neonate is an issue of concern to parents, nurses and 
doctors. There are several theories about why neonates lose weight. The 
most common theory is that babies are born with extra weight to help with 
the stress caused by labor and the transition to extra-uterine life. Also 
the extra fat stores are there because mother's mature milk does not come 
in for 3-5 days. A weight loss of 5% in the first week of life is 
considered normal for the bottle fed infant. A loss of 7% is average in the 
first week for the breastfed infant, 10% is the absolute maximum. If the 
baby loses 7% in the first 72 hours, breastfeeding should be observed by a 
trained professional for proper technique and milk transfer. If the baby is 
nursing well, appears otherwise healthy, and has appropriate stooling 
patterns another weight check should be scheduled in two days. As a parent 
you will need to monitor your child`s weight at home. If you don’t have a 
scale at home, you can monitor your baby’s intake of food and certain 
behaviors. By about week one, your newborn should be having at least 5-7 
wet diapers a day and at least about 3-4 dirty diapers a day. Your baby 
should seem satisfied at least for a little while after feeding. Your baby 
should remain alert during the “awake” times and not seem overly sleepy. If 
you notice any of the above mentioned concerns in your child, contact your 
child`s doctor right away.
