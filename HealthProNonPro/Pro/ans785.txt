It is very common to experience irregular and heavy periods during 
menopause. Due to the changes occurring in the body and the hormonal 
system, it is usual for women to experience changes in the menstruation 
like heavy bleeding, spotting or no periods followed by heavy bleeding. 
Before your periods stop completely, they generally become either more 
closely or widely spaced. This irregularity may last for 1 - 3 years before 
menstruation finally ends completely.
