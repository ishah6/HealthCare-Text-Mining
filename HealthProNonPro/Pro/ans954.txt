Pain after IUD insertion could be caused by various reasons. If sexual 
intercourse exacerbates the discomfort, or if there is development of new 
vaginal discharge or odor and underlying gynecological problem may be the 
cause. Your doctor may need to do a vaginal speculum examination, during 
which the presence/absence and length of the IUD string is noted. 
Misalignment in the IUD may cause discomfort. In addition, the presence of 
cervical motion tenderness as well as adnexal tenderness, fullness, or mass 
is also noted. This could indicate a cervical infection or 
endometritis/upper genital tract infection (pelvic inflammatory disease). 
If antibiotic treatment resolves the patient's symptoms, IUD removal is not 
indicated. However, if uterine tenderness persists despite treatment, 
removal of the IUD may indeed be appropriate.
