I do understand your concern after a positive fecal occult blood test 
(FOBT). A positive FOBT result could be due to condition other than cancer 
too, such as polyps, hemorrhoids, inflammatory bowel of the disease or even 
after taking iron tablets.I would advise that you talk to your doctor regarding your concerns and 
fears about undergoing a colonoscopy. It is always better to investigate 
the cause of bleeding. I wish you well, take care.
