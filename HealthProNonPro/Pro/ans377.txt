Home pregnancy test and especially EPTs are fairly accurate in detecting 
pregnancy. It usually takes 10-14 days after implantation for the HCG 
levels to reach a minimum level at which it can be detected via these 
tests. For more accurate and earlier determination of pregnancy you can do 
a pregnancy blood test.Sometimes stress, excessive exercises and hormonal imbalances may lead to a 
delayed periods. You will need to consult your doctor if you experience 
delayed or irregular periods.
