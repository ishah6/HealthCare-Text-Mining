Urinary incontinence is the involuntary loss of urine which may cause sever 
distress to a patient. There are various risk factors that predisposes to 
urinary incontinence. Lower back injury, high impact physical activities, 
diabetes, stroke, depression, fecal and genitourinary surgery could all 
cause urinary incontinence. I have noted that in your history you've 
mentioned of having had a stroke 10 years ago. However, I would suggest 
that you see a doctor, preferably a urologist for a complete blood work-up, 
imaging studies and cystoscopy to determine the cause of incontinence. 
Treatment will depend on the cause. I hope the information helps, take care.
