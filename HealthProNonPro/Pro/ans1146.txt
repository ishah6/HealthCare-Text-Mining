Thank you for your question. If semen were to get into her vaginal canal 
through your clothes, it is certainly possible for impregnation to occur. 
However, the risk of this happening is very low. It is quite unlikely for 
your partner to become impregnated from this type of sexual contact. We 
recommend that she await the start of your period. If this happens normally 
then you need not be concerned. Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
