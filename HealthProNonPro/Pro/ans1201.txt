Thank you for your question. Ovacare forte is a nutritional supplement, not 
a prescription medication. It is sometimes taken by women to assist with 
any associated vitamin deficiencies associated with heave menstrual 
bleeding. According to our knowledge of this supplement it is not indicated 
as a weight loss supplement. We would rather you stick to the prescribed 
medications from your physician rather than taking supplements that are not 
approved treatments for PCOS. Please follow up with your doctor to 
determine what will be the best treatment for your hair loss, and 
associated symptoms.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
