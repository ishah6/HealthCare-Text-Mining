I do not think that there is anything wrong with you. It is difficult to 
point out the factor which could be causing an increase in the amount of 
ejaculate. The increased volume of ejaculate could be due to age, overall 
health and diet. Frequency of sexual activity also contributes to the 
increase of ejaculate. If you abstain for a day or two, you'll certainly be 
producing more ejaculate than you would be ejaculating every few hours. I 
hope this helps, take care.
