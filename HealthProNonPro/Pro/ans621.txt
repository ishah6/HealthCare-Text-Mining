In a small percentage of women, the muscular contractions of the uterus 
push the coil out of place or expel it from the uterus. This is usually 
seen within the first few months of insertion of the coil. If the coil has 
been dislodged, you may be able to feel the lower end of the device, or you 
may experience persistent pain or abnormal bleeding, or you or your partner 
may feel pain or discomfort during intercourse. I would suggest that you 
follow up with your gynaecologist to see whether the coil is placed where 
its meant to be. I hope this helps, take care.
