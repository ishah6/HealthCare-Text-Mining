I do understand your concern. Anal fissures can be quite painful and 
distressing. The initial treatment for anal fissure is usually medical with 
sitz bath and stool softeners to relieve the symptoms. If these measures do 
not help, intra-anal application of nitroglycerine rectal ointment may also 
be considered. Other treatments such as calcium channel blockers and 
localized injections of botulinum toxin have all been shown to provide some 
relief of symptoms and in some cases may cure the condition.However the gold standard of treatment is surgical correction of the 
fissure. The operation is called a lateral sphincterotomy. This procedure 
reduces spasm and therefore reduces pain. It also allows for greater blood 
flow to area which in turn allows the fissure to heal.There may be a risk of rectal cancer in patients with a family history of 
colon cancer, have colorectal polyps and are above 50 years in age.
