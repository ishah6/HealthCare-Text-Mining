Gynecomastia is swelling of the breast tissue in males caused by an 
imbalance of the hormones estrogen and testosterone. Gynecomastia can 
affect one or both breasts. Gynecomastia isn't a serious problem, and may 
resolve on its own, but if it doesn't, medication or surgery may help. 
Gynecomastia caused by hormone changes during puberty is relatively common. 
In most cases, the swollen breast tissue will go away without treatment 
within six months to two years. A number of medications can also cause 
gynecomastia, these include anabolic steroids, antidepressants and certain 
antibiotics. Your doctor may do certain blood tests to check for the levels 
of estrogen and testosterone and also do a mammogram. Further tests will 
depend on the finding of the initial tests. In adolescents with no 
underlying cause of gynecomastia, a doctor may recommend periodic 
re-evaluations every three to six months to see if the condition improves 
on its own. If gynecomastia fails to resolve, medical or surgical treatment 
may be warranted.
