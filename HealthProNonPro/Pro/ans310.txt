First of all, when riding a bicycle you should wear protective gear 
meaning: helmet and padding, because one of the most serious of all bike 
injuries is a head injury. If you do develop an ache, pain or injury while 
cycling, it is likely to be among the following: knee pain due to 
Patellofemoral Syndrome, hand numbness due to ulnar nerve lesion. On the 
other hand if you crash you could have: sprains and strains, clavicle 
fracture, long bones fractures, abrasions and road rash, and of course a 
concussion or skull fracture. Whether you are riding to the corner store or 
across the country, you should be comfortable on your bike and wear the 
protective gear at all times. If you have neck, back, or knee pain, saddle 
sores, or hand or foot numbness, your bicycle probably doesn't fit you 
properly. So you have to make sure that the saddle is adjusted right, also 
the handlebar has to be at a comfortable height.
