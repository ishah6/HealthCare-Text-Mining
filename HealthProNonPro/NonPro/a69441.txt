Grow up.  When you have a girlfriend, you cant have sexual contact with other women.  And dont tell me its an accident, as you have said that you cheated on girlfriends, which means its happened more than once.

If you cant be monogamous to someone, then dont get into a relationship with them!  Youre not vulnerable, youre immature and you dont deserve a girlfriend if you cant keep your parts to yourself.
