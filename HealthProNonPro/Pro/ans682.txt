It is difficult for a mother to see her children suffer and I can 
understand your concern. In my opinion, vomiting and bad breath (halitosis) 
all suggestive of a reflux disease. Generally physicians treat this 
condition with medication that decrease the acid content in the stomach. 
Your doctor has started your child on this treatment (Prevasid). If the 
symptoms are not relieved on this medication, the next step would be a 24 
hour pH probe done by a specialist. Endoscopy is another test that can be 
done to see if there is any damage in the lining of esophagus and stomach 
and is performed if empiric treatment fails.
