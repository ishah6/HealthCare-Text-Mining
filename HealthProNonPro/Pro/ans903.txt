Most likely you may be experiencing a bacterial infection of the upper 
layers of the skin called Impetigo caused by streptococcus or 
Staphylococcus bacteria. The most common form of impetigo often occurs on 
the face or limbs, and is known for its "honey-colored" crust. This crust 
often looks like small blisters. Impetigo is often diagnosed clinically, 
based on the characteristic appearance. However, because impetigo can be 
confused with several other skin conditions, certain tests may be needed to 
make the diagnosis. The most common diagnostic tests performed are a gram 
stain or bacterial culture obtained by swabbing the base of a lesion with a 
cotton swab. The treatment is with topical antibiotics applied to the area 
until the lesion is gone. Sometimes in more severe cases oral antibiotics 
are required.
