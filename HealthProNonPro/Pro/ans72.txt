Acne vulgaris is a common skin disease characterized by open or closed 
comeddones, papules, pustules and nodules. It is caused by the plugging of 
pores in the skin resulting in accumulation of oil, dirt and bacteria. 
Though there are many factor in the pathogenesis of acne, genetics plays an 
important role. You are more likely to have acne if one of your parents had 
them.Treatment is usually directed towards the pathogen causing acne 
(Propionibacterium acnes). Topical retinoids, oral or topical antibiotics, 
benzoyl peroxide are the mainstay of therapy. Isotretinoin is a systemic 
retinoid that is highly effective in the treatment of severe and scarring 
forms of acne. Diet therapy and exercise has been suggested. Data suggest 
that avoiding junk fatty foods greatly improved the general skin health.
