While osteoarthritis can damage any joint in your body, the disorder most 
commonly affects joints in your hands, neck, lower back, knees and hips. 
Sore joints in the fingers may be caused by arthritis, inflammation, and 
age-related wear and tear. Depending on the cause, your pain may be short 
term and disappear quickly, or it may develop slowly over weeks or months. 
A complete physical examination. blood-work and imaging studies like x-ray 
of the hand and wrist and CT will help in the diagnosis.
