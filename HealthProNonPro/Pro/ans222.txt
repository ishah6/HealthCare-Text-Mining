Delay creams for premature ejaculation often contain topical anesthetics 
such as lidocaine or prilocaine that dull the sensation on the penis to 
help delay ejaculation. The most common side-effect of using these creams 
is the reduced sexual pleasure because of decreased sensitivity. Often the 
female partners may also complain of reduced genital sensitivity and 
decreased sexual pleasure.It is seen that combination therapy with psychotherapy, sexual therapy and 
medication give the best results in the treatment of PE.
