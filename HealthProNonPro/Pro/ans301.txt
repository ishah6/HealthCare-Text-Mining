Fibroids are extremely common in women in their thirties and forties. The 
effect of fibroid on pregnancy depend on their size and location. Fibroids 
that change shape or protrude into the uterine cavity may decrease 
fertility in 70% of cases and may also cause miscarriage in some. Fibroids 
that are present in the uterine wall and those that are outside the wall of 
the uterus have little effect in pregnancy. Usually most women with 
fibroids go on to full term and deliver normally but the chances of 
cesarean is higher as compared with a women with no fibroids.
