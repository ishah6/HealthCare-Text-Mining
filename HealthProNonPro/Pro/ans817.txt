Kegel exercises are done to help strengthen the pelvic floor muscles. The 
pelvic floor muscles help control your urine flow. There is no evidence 
that shows that kegel exercises help in premature ejaculation.Premature ejaculation is mainly a psychological problem. There may be 
increased levels of anxiety and stress to perform. Relieving anxiety by 
communicating with your partner and reducing stress by meditation, exercise 
will help.Another method is the start-stop method that increases the ejaculatory 
control. If these measures do not help, I would suggest that you consult 
your doctor, medications like Dapoxetine (an antidepressant) may help in 
sever cases of premature ejaculation.
