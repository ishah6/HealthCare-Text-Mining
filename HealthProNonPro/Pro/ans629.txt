In my opinion there is no need for you to be concerned about the swelling 
in your chin. The swelling is most probably a swollen lymph node due to the 
sore throat and should resolve shortly after the infection subsides. I 
would suggest that you gargle with warm saline and take over the counter 
anti-inflammatory medication like motrin/advil if there is tenderness of 
the swelling.
