shieet. why do you want to get rid of them? i love em. i dont get them often enough. damn. sometimes i reverse the strategies listed above to try to get them. drinking hot milk and and gulping cold air. enjoy the ride on a hiccup train. 

they never last long anyways so if you dont like them for some strange reason, itll pass.
