I do understand your concern. Acute pharyngitis is one of the most common 
conditions I have encountered in office practice. The major treatable 
pathogen is group A streptococcus (GAS). Approximately ten percent of sore 
throats in adults yield positive cultures for GAS. Determining an optimal 
diagnostic and management strategy for adults with pharyngitis involves 
balancing the risks of under treatment vs the risks of over treatment (drug 
resistance, antibiotic side effects, and allergic reactions). Though throat 
cultures have been the "gold standard" for diagnosing GAS pharyngitis, your 
doctor may want to investigate and treat you for GAS depending on your 
symptoms. Your doctor may want to start you on antibiotics if you meet any 
of the criteria of treatment that includes :Tonsillar exudatesTender anterior cervical adenopathyFever by historyAbsence of coughIf three or four criteria are met, the positive predictive value for the 
presence of GAS in the pharynx is 40 to 60 percent.
