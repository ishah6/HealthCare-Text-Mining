I understand your concern about bloody stools. Bright red blood in the 
stool suggests bleeding from lower end of the gastrointestinal tract. This 
can be due to a number of reasons including hemorrhoids, gastro-intestinal 
infection and inflammatory bowel disease. I advise attending your family physician for a detailed history of the 
bleeding and a clinical examination. Investigations such as colonoscopy or 
sigmoidoscopy, stool examination may be required to help determine the 
cause of blood in stool.
