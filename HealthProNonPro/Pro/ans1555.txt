There are sever factors that can lead to decreased sperm motility also 
called asthenozoospermia. If a diagnosis of decreased sperm motility is 
made, the test should be repeated to assure that condition did not cause 
the problem. Causes of decreased sperm motility include abnormal 
spermatotogenesis, epididymal sperm maturation problems, transport 
abnormalities and varicocele. All these conditions may need to be evaluated 
by your doctor if your sperm motility is repeatedly low.
