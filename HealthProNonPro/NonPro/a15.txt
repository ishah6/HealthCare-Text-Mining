A key cause of obesity is the low nutritional content of industrially processed foods--because the body doesnt receive enough nutrition it continues to crave more food. Few diets focus, as they should, on non-processed nutritionally dense food--instead, in many cases, the patient is actually eating even more processed food products, exacerbating rather than solving the problem.<br />

Bottom line, as we hear so often, obesity is largely caused by bad habits in terms of diet and exercise, and many people arent willing to permanently let go of those habits, so its hardly surprising when they fail to achieve the results they want.
