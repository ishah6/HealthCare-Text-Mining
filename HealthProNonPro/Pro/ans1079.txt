Strabismus or squint is the misalignment of the eyes in which the eyes do 
not line in the same direction. Esotropia is the inward deviation of the 
eyes and exotropia is the outward of the eyes. The most common cause of 
exodeviation in children is intermittent exotropia. Intermittent exotropia 
is the most common exodeviation of childhood, affecting almost 1 percent of 
the general population. A variety of treatments have been proposed for 
intermittent exotropia. However, no single treatment has proven superior 
for all cases, and long-term follow-up demonstrates a high recurrence rate 
regardless of initial therapy. I would suggest that you consult your 
optholmologist for further evaluation. The treatment modalities present are 
corrective lenses, occlusion therapy, over-minused spectacles, and 
orthoptic exercises.
