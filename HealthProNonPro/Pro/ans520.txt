I do understand your concern. Since you've had no problems with the 
injections for 2 years, I do not think that your period pain could be due 
to the injectable contraceptive. Though irregular periods, bleeding and 
abdominal pain is a side effect of injectable contraceptives, it is usually 
seen during the early usage period. I would suggest that you see you 
gynecologist to rule out other causes such as a pelvic inflammatory disease 
or fibroids.
