It is most likely that your symptoms of flatulence (increased gas) is 
related to your diet. I would advise that you restrict food from the diet 
which may aggravate your symptoms. These include beans, lentils, dairy 
products, onions, garlic, scallions, leeks, turnips, rutabagas, radishes, 
sweet potatoes, potatoes, cashews, oats, wheat, and yeast in breads, 
cauliflower, broccoli, cabbage, and brussels sprouts. You can also try 
taking probiotics that will help reduce symptoms of flatulence. Activated 
charcoal and antacids like di-gel that contain simethicone may also be used.
