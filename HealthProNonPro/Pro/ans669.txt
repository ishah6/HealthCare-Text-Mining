It certainly seem that you have either a lipoma or a sebaceous cyst. 
Sebaceous cysts can become inflamed or infected causing an increase in size 
and tenderness. Both these conditions do not require any treatment. If you 
feel that the cyst or lipoma is growing in size, you may ask your doctor to 
surgically remove the lump.
