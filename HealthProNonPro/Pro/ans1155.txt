Thank you for your question. In general, we do not recommend taking any 
tonics, herbal supplements, and vitamins that are not prescribed by a 
doctor, nor approved by the FDA. Since the product you have mentioned, is a 
homeopathic product we are not certain if there are any components to it 
that will enter the breast milk and subsequently your child while he or she 
nurses. We recommend that you refrain from taking this tonic until after 
you complete nursing. If you would still like to take this tonic, we 
recommend that you first bring the tonic to your doctor to have them study 
its contents and determine if it is safe for you to ingest while 
breastfeeding.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
