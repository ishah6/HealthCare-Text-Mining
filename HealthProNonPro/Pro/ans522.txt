I do understand your concern. Sometimes when you start working out, more 
isn't always better. If you take your workout aggressively and pushing 
yourself too hard, you may end up getting nauseated, dizzy and may even 
throw up. Intense exercise may interfere with the lining of the stomach and 
oesopahgus causing the strong acids of the stomach to cause damage. It is 
very easy to become severely dehydrated after exercising if you're not 
careful to drink enough fluids. I would advise that if you're new to 
exercise, take it slow and gradually workup your endurance level. If you 
experience dizziness, it is important to stop doing the routine and sit 
down, to prevent you from falling and injuring yourself. I hope this helps, 
take care.
