The rash you are experiencing may be due to cercarial dermatitis also known 
as a swimmer's itch. This is caused by an allergic reaction to bacteria and 
parasites in the water. The symptoms include development of small reddish 
pimples that are associated with itching and burning sensation. Pimples may 
develop into small blisters. Itching may last up to a week or more, but 
will gradually go away. Do not scratch the bumps as it may lead to 
bacterial infection. In most cases the symptoms are relieved by 
corticosteroid cream, calamine lotion or any over the counter anti-itch 
lotion.
