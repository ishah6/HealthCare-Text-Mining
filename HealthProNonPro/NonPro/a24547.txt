You should be a vegetarian because you want to be one. Ususally the reasons people choose to be vegetarians are 1) health reasons - low fat (prevention of heart disease), but not necessarily a guarenteed way to lose weight. 2) Personal Beliefs - animals should not be harmed or exploited for the benefit of man or 3) Religious beliefs - buddhist monks do not eat meat.
There are some people who believe that humans need to get their protiens from animal/animal products. The final decision is yours.
