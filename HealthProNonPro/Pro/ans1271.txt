Thank you for your question. Unfortunately your photograph did not upload. 
Given the history of skin cancer in your family we strongly recommend that 
you have these nevi (moles) examined by a dermatologist. One of the signs 
that a mole is become malignant is changes in colour. Since your moles have 
darkened, we are concerned that these in fact may be malignant. The only 
way to know for certain is to have a surgical biopsy of the mole performed 
in order to determine the cells comprising the mole are cancerous in 
nature. Please see your doctor for further evaluation. Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com with your medical question.
