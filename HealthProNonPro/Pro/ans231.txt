Different blood pressure medication reduce high blood pressure by different 
mechanisms. ACE inhibitors allow the blood vessels to widen by preventing a 
hormone called angiotensin. Beta blockers help blood vessels relax and 
calcium channel blockers prevent calcium from going into the heart and 
blood vessel muscle causing them to relax.It is unlikely that any of the blood pressure medication would have caused 
your abdominal clot. Hypertension, obesity, high blood lipids and thyroid 
disorders are certainly risk factors that increase the chances of 
thrombosis. I would advise that you consult your doctor before altering any 
medication and for further information, take care.
