Though your chances of pregnancy are minimal due to use of contraceptive 
pill, however you may need to do a pregnancy test to be sure. In case your 
pregnancy test is also negative this time and you still haven't got your 
periods then i would advice a hormonal blood test along with an ultrasound 
of the pelvis. All the best,
