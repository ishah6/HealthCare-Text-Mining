I wouldnt mind knowing the answer to this question as well.  I am also a hearing impaired man, 31 yrs old, whose parents and siblings have normal hearing.  Ive been classified as severely hearing impaired - my loss is around the 75-80% mark.  However, I can converse normally just fine.  Most people dont even realize that I am hearing impaired - however, I dont have any children; so I am a bit concerned as for when I have kids.  But due to the fact that my immediate family are all normal as far as hearing goes, I believe my loss was due to the circumstance of my birth, of which I have sketchy details.  So I would think my odds of having children that have normal hearing would be better than one would think.

I really hope this helps.
