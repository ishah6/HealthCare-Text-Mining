Breast pain is common in women. Evaluation of breast pain is important to 
determine whether the pain is due to normal physiological changes related 
to hormonal fluctuation or to a pathological process. In my opinion, your 
breast pain may be due to cyclical breast discomfort caused by normal 
hormonal changes associated with ovulation. You may need to see you doctor 
if the breast pain increases in severity and hampers your day to day 
routine. A well-fitting brassiere to better support the breast, warm 
compresses or ice packs or a nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug (NSAID) may 
help relieve the symptoms.
