Thank you for your question. It is possible that this was an episode of 
somnambulism that your friend experienced. Commonly known as sleep walking, 
Somnambulism occurs during the third and fourth stages of the the sleep 
cycle when sleep is at its deepest. This may have been an isolated episode 
or it can be do to a sleep disorder that she has developed. To best 
determine if she is suffering from a sleep disorder she would need to 
consult a doctor who specializes in sleep disorders to conduct the 
appropriate medical evaluation and diagnostic testing (including a sleep 
study).
