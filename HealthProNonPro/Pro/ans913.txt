Most women can usually start driving 3-4 weeks after gynaecological 
surgery. You must should make sure before starting to drive that you are 
comfortable doing an emergency stop. You should be certain that you have 
the strength to press on the brake pedal hard enough to stop at speed. You 
should also be aware of the position of the seat belt in relation to the 
site of their surgery. I would advise you to have a physical examination by 
your doctor before any attempt to return to driving.
