I do understand your concern for your daughter's health. Healthy children 
may cough on a daily basis and is an important defensive reflex that 
protects from aspiration of foreign materials. However, a cough may also be 
the presenting symptom of a serious underlying pulmonary or extrapulmonary 
disease.Evaluation of a chough in a child is very different to that of an adult. 
Children with chronic cough should be evaluated with a detailed history, 
physical examination, chest radiograph, and spirometry if the child is 
able. Further evaluation depends on the provisional diagnosis and the 
course of the symptoms. The causes of specific chronic cough fall into the 
following general categories ;i) Specific cough - as a result of asthma, persistent bacterial bronchitis, 
chronic suppurative lung disease and bronchiectasis, airway abnormality, 
interstitial lung disease and extra-pulmonary causes such as cardiac 
disease and ear infections.ii) Nonspecific cough - is when symptoms suggesting specific cough are 
absent and the chest radiograph and spirometry are normal.I would suggest that you consult a pediatric respirologist to determine the 
cause of your child's chronic cough. If the cough is troublesome, the 
possibility of asthma should be considered and pursued with an empiric 
trial of bronchodilators and other asthma medications. If there is no 
response, the child should be considered to have a nonspecific cough, and 
the medication should be stopped. The only treatment needed for nonspecific 
cough is reassurance and observation of the child over time to see for 
possible emergence of specific symptoms.
