If the fever is low grade meaning around 100 degrees, then let it run its course. The fever is the result of your body trying to fight the infection. For a sore throat, try chloraseptic and throat lozenges. Also gargling with hot as you can stand it salt water will help. You should probably see a doctor though because you could have strep throat.
