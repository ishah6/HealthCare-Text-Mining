EGFR or estimated Glomerular Filtration Rate is a test to detect early 
kidney damage and to monitor kidney status. It is performed by ordering a 
creatinine test and calculating the eGFR. It is ordered to monitor those 
with known kidney disease and those with conditions such as diabetes and 
hypertension that may lead to kidney damage. Normal values are 90-120 
ml/min, an eGFR below 60 ml/min suggests that some kidney damage has 
occurred.
