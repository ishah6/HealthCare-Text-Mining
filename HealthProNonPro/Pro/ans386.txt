I agree with your doctor about stop taking the shakes and stay hidrated. 
Exercise may stimulate the production of red blood cells to carry oxygen 
throughout the body to active muscles. Sometimes strenuous exercise can 
lead to blood in the urine, or hematuria. Also, blood in the urine, may be 
caused by infections, kidney or bladder stones or an enlarged prostate 
gland for men over the age of 50. Exercise or activity resulting in 
proteinuria, or protein in the urine, if it episodic, may be normal for 
younger people. Exercise changes the flow of blood inside the kidneys. 
According to a rat study published in the June 1, 2010 issue of the 
"Journal of Sports Science and Medicine", acute exercise increases urinary 
protein excretion. In the July 18, 2003 issue of "Journal of Applied 
Physiology," researchers at Akdeniz University in Turkey found that 
exercise-induced increases in nitric oxide decreases blood flow in the 
kidney, leading to temporary proteinuria after exercise.
