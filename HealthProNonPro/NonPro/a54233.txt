sorry this is vague, but I seem to recall an inmate in the 1970s who went on a widely publicized hunger strike until he died...and it took more than 40 days, I think around 45.  He was in pretty bad shape for most of it though.  Maybe someone else remembers this incident and can be more accurate with the stats.
