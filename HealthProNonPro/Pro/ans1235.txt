Thank you for your question. The source of your neck pain could be due to 
strained muscles of the neck. This can be caused by poor posture, sudden 
traumatic injury like in a motor vehicle accident, or even due to sleeping 
on a pillow that does not adequately support your neck. The headaches 
associated with your neck pain is likely due to your strained neck muscles. 
Since this has been happening for three weeks now, it would be best to have 
your doctor examine your neck to make sure there are no severe underlying 
injuries to the cervical spine which require further treatment. In the 
meantime, in addition to analgesic medication you can apply a heating pad 
to your neck to loosen the muscles and assist in alleviating the pain. 
Please see your doctor.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
