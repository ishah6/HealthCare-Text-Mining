Though you may be having a kidney infection but according to what you have 
written, it is more probable that you are suffering from either PID, 
endometriosis, fibroids or dysfunctional uterine bleeding. Unfortunately 
there is no way I can point out the cause of your back pain and bleeding. 
You will have to see a doctor/gynecologist for an internal examination and 
further evaluation.
