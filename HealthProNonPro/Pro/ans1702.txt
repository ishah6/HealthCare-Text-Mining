Vitamin C is a potent antioxidant and benefits the skin by removing the 
free radicals that cause uneven skin pigmentation. Though there is no 
scientific study on the effects of vitamin C on skin color. If the use of 
vitamin C has improved your skin results, I would advice you to continue 
its use.
