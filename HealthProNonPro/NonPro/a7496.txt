Forget the aspirin tablets! Take a mineral salt bath! Better yet take a bath with a 1/2 cup baking soda and 1/2 cup sea salt.(available at health food stores or the health section of your local grocer.)You can find an array of pre-mixed bath salts to ease sore muscles. Dont forget about meditating and breathing deep to re-oxiginate muscles. Most important drink all your daily 8 glasses of h20 a day! Namaste.
