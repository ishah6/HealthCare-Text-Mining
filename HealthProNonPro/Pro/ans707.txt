It is difficult for me to tell whether you will be cleared for surgery or 
not. All I can tell you is that high pre-operative sugar levels can 
increase the risk of developing blood clots, infection, renal failure and 
even death. I would advise you to consult with your doctor for ways i which 
you could control your blood sugar levels before surgery.
