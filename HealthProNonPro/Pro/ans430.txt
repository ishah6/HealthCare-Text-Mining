I do understand your concern about your wife's bleeding after medical 
termination of pregnancy. Vaginal bleeding is common and typically heavier 
than a period, but not usually excessive. Usually bleeding may last 
anywhere from 8 to 17 days, but in some may even continue till 60 days. 
Medical abortion is effective in upto 90-98% of the cases. However, since 
the ultrasound was clear we can rule out retained products of conception as 
the cause of bleeding. Depending on how far along in the pregnancy your 
wife was, it can take from 6-24 months before the body and hormonal systems 
return to normal.
