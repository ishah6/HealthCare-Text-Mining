The rashes on your abdomen are due to pregnancy hormone (estrogen) and the 
stretching of the abdominal skin due to the growing baby. This is normally 
seen in pregnancy and usually disappears straight after delivery. Try 
applying moisturizer and wear loose cotton clothing. If the itching 
increases in severity and is present throughout the body, consult your 
doctor to rule out obstetric cholestasis, which is a rare pregnancy 
condition that affects the liver and causes you to feel itchy.
