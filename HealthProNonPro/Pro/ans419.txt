I do understand you concern about the management of hepatitis b and c 
infection. It is recommended that you take the following steps :i) If you drink alcohol, it is most important that you stop drinking 
alcoholic beverages because alcohol puts additional strain on the liver 
worsening the condition.ii) You should see your doctor for immunization against hepatitis A.iii) You will need medical supervision. Though antiretroviral treatment is 
available, it is not recommended for everyone. Treatment will depend on 
regular monitoring and extent of development of liver damage.I do understand that you do not have a health insurance, but I would 
recommend that you go to your doctor for regular evaluation of the 
infection. Your doctor may require blood tests to see liver functioning 
such as Bilirubin, ALT and AST levels and also blood tests for the virus 
(HBeAg, anti-HBe, HBV DNA and HCV RNA). I hope the information helps you, I 
wish you well.
