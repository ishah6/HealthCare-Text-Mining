I strongly recommend that you get the Doppler done to rule out a possible 
vascular insufficiency with or without a clot causing your symptoms. You 
have already a predisposing factor as you stated in your question : be 
seated for so many hours in a bus. The pain that is associated with muscle 
cramps that are caused by poor circulation to the legs that worsens with 
walking is referred to as claudication. Deficiencies of certain vitamins or 
minerals, including iron deficiency, thiamine (B1), pantothenic acid (B5), 
and pyridoxine(B6), can also cause muscle cramps. Muscle cramps usually 
cause a temporary nuisance and typically resolve on their own without 
treatment. When muscle cramps continually recur, it is time to seek an 
evaluation by a physician. The primary treatment of muscle cramps involves 
methods to relax the affected muscle. This typically involves stretching, 
massage, and heat application. Other treatments are directed toward the 
underlying cause of the muscle cramps and can include rehydration, 
electrolyte repletion, hormone treatment, calcium supplementation.
