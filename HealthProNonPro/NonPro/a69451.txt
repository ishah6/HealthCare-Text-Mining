Well, think about it---if this has happened SIX times, then maybe youre the one doing something wrong. You cant stereotype all women because were all different, just like all men are different. Your example of crying during a movie is a completely different situation.
And "following your instincts" isnt always the best thing to do. Apply some common sense to your instincts...look before you leap. And always consider your girlfriends feelings when you "follow your instincts". Honestly, how would you feel? Men arent neccesarily "vulnerable" to these things...not if you have self-control.
Good luck with your relationships in the future =)
