Just because we are vulnerable doesnt mean we should always give in.  Theres no such thing as accidently cheating on a girl 5 times!  

Cheating is not a vulnerability - its a vice.  And its not something that any woman should put up with.  If you want to get and keep a girlfriend, then you need to grow up.
