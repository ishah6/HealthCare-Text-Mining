Very good.  Any young person who is full enough to have sex with someone that doesnt use protection is as dumb as can be.  You are literally getting exposed to EVERY person that the other person has ever slept with. 

Be it STDs or pregnancy, unprotected sex is just plain irresponsible, and unitelligent.
