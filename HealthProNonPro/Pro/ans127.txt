Basically, the MRI report that you transcribed in your question, in 
layman terms, describe a contusion that involved the distal part of the 
femur and the patella and a Meniscus tear, it does not state the degree of 
tear, but, hopefully would be a small one. Meniscus injuries are a common 
problem in sports and in young active individuals; they are the most 
frequent injury to the knee joint. The menisci are C -shaped 
fibrocartilaginous structures attached to the tibia and their main 
functions to enhance the contact between the two articular surfaces of the 
knee: femur and tibia ones. Sometimes these injuries are associated with 
ACL or collateral ligaments tears, this does not seem to be the case with 
your son. If the meniscus lesion is mild and the ligament tear is partial, 
conservative treatment can be used. Spontaneous healing is common because 
of the rich blood supply in the meniscus periphery. Successful recovery 
from a meniscus tear is helped by a gradual resolution of symptoms over 6 
weeks with a return to normal activity by 3 months. But in more severe 
cases (complete torn meniscus and/or ligaments) the arthroscopic repair 
surgery must be considered.
