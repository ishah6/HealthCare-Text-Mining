The most common cause of foul smelling vaginal discharge and irritation is 
due to bacterial vaginosis. Antibiotics like metronidazole and clindamycin 
are affective in bacterial vaginosis. Other causes could be vaginal thrush. 
Usually the discharge seen in vaginal thrush is whitish in color and is 
accompanied by intense pruritus leading to redness and inflammation in the 
area. You may need an antifungal medication like fluconazole which is 
available both as an ointment and an oral medication. If your symptoms do 
not resolve with this treatment, then you may need see your 
doctor/gynecologist. A swab test may be done to identify the organism. 
treatment will depend on the cause. I would advise you not to use any other 
creams, tampons or deodorants in the affected area.
