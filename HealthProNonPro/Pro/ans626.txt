In most programs, donation is restricted to family members and close 
friends who are between 18 and 55 years of age. The potential donor must be 
in good health and must undergo several tests to ensure that the liver is 
working well. Removing a portion of the donor's liver is major surgery, and 
the possible complications include bleeding, bile duct injury and infection.
