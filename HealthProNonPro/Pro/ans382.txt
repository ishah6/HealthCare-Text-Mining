Human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) is produced by trophoblast (cells that 
form the placenta). Levels can first be detected by a blood test about 10 
days after conception. The level will reach its peak in the first 8 - 11 
weeks of pregnancy and then will decline and level off for the remainder of 
the pregnancy. The normal level for hCG after 5 months is 3,640 - 117,000 
mIU/ml (though this may differ from individual to individual).High levels of hCG may be caused due to miscalculation of pregnancy dating, 
multiple pregnancy or molar pregnancy. I would suggest that your wife 
consult her doctor for further evaluation of high hCG levels.
