The back pain that you have mentioned is most probably caused due to 
musculo-skeletal strain. Rest , analgesic ointments, good back support and 
medications like Ibuprofen (NSAIDS) will help. If you noticed that even 
after taking medications the symptoms are not improving, pain becomes more 
severe, you develop bowel incontinence or urinary retention, you must see 
your doctor urgently. I hope the information helps.
