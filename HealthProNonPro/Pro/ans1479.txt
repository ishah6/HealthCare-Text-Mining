The swollen and painful testicle could be due to orchitis. This is most 
commonly viral and is usually seen after mumps. Other causes could include 
infection with coxsackie B virus, and bacterial infections such as E. coli 
and klebsiella pneumoniae. Diagnosis is based on clinical examination and 
supported by laboratory tests and ultrasonographic findings. There is no 
specific treatment of viral orchitis and is usually supportive. Bacterial 
orchitis will require antibiotic therapy.
