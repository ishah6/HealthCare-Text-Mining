I understand that your main concern is the bloodwork results that showed 
mild anemia, slightly decreased white blood cells. On the other hand, in a 
nutshell, high BUN values can indicate kidney disease, congestive heart 
failure, gastrointestinal bleeding, shock, kidney failure, hypovolemia, a 
heart attack or a urinary tract obstruction. Low BUN values may occur as a 
result of liver failure, malnutrition or over-hydration, which is a 
condition in which too much fluid accumulates in the body. If your 
creatinine values are higher than normal, it can indicate kidney failure, 
glomerulonephritis, dehydration, urinary tract obstruction, diabetic 
nephropathy or reduced blood flow to the kidneys due to congestive heart 
failure or shock. Low creatinine values may occur as a result of muscular 
dystrophy or myasthenia gravis. Normal BUN/creatinine ratios fall between 
10 to 1 and 20 to 1. An increased ratio can indicate congestive heart 
failure or dehydration. A decreased ratio can indicate gastrointestinal 
bleeding, liver disease or malnutrition. If you are worried about these 
results, I strongly recommend to discuss them with your doctor in order to 
determine the possible causes for such values.
