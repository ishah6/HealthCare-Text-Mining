Most sore throat are caused by viral infection which run its course and no 
treatment is required. In certain cases there viral infection may make one 
susceptible for a bacterial infection, which may be in your case. Your 
symptoms of neck swelling and post nasal drip (slime coated mouth) may be 
due to a bacterial infection. I would suggest that you see your doctor for 
a throat swab to rule out streptococcal throat infection and appropriate 
antibiotics. I wish yo well, take care.
