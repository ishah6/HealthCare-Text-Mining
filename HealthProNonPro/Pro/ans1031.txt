Renal cysts result from genetic or nongenetic processes, and occur in a 
variety of diseases in adults. What your mom may be having is a simple 
renal cyst which are commonly observed in normal kidneys, with an 
increasing incidence as individuals age. They are benign asymptomatic 
lesions that rarely require treatment. Simple renal cysts typically produce 
no symptoms or signs. If basic ultrasonography criteria for a benign simple 
cyst are met, further study is not required. A CT scan should be performed 
if the ultrasonogram is equivocal. The vast majority of simple cysts 
require no treatment. Therapy may rarely be required if the cysts are 
associated with with rupture (hemorrhage), hematuria, pain, abdominal mass, 
infection, and/or hypertension.
