In addition to the very helpful links provided by the earlier poster, it may be that newborns appear "hairy" without having a disorder (usually the term hirsutism implies an abnormality). 

A developing fetus is commonly covered with hair called lanugo hair during gestation. This hair is thought to have some insulating properties and be there because babies lack insulating fat at this time. About 36-40 weeks of gestation this lanugo hair is shed and replaced with vellus hair, a soft, peach fuzz looking hair. Some

Here is a picture of a newborn with lanugo hair still present: http://www.babylink.info/Edinburgh/FAQ/..%5Cimages%5CLanugo1.jpg

If the newborn is premature it may still be covered with lanugo hair, which will eventually be shed. It may also be that the vellus hair is mistaken for abnormal hair on a newborn. Sometimes lanugo hair on newborns "runs in families."

Hope this is helpful.
