Thank you for your question. Parasitic infections can indeed infect your 
growing fetus. The decision to treat your infection with antiparasitic 
medication is determined based on the risk of treatment versus the benefits 
in protection of your pregnancy. In general, antiparasitic medications do 
not pose any severe risk to a growing fetus, however this must carefully be 
considered before commencing treatment. What is important is that you 
follow up with your doctor to make sure you are definitively diagnosed with 
amoebiasis by providing a stool sample. If diagnosed, then treatment 
options will be considered which is safest for your growing fetus.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
