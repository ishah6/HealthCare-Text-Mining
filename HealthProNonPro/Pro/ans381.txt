How long a drug takes to work will depend on several factors like peak time 
concentration, drug half like and drug metabolism which differs from 
individual to individual. However, you should see clinical improvements 
within 2-3 days of taking the drug. If you experience no symptomatic 
improvements even after 5 days of taking the drug, you may then have to 
consult your physician.
