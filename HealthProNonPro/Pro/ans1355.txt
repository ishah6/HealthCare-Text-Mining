The heavy bleeding that you are experiencing could be the result in an 
imbalance in the hormones estrogen and progesterone. I would advise that 
you consult your gynecologist for a complete physical examination. Blood 
work like a complete blood count, iron studies, coagulation factors, 
thyroid function tests, prolactin levels, hormone assays and liver function 
test may be ordered by your doctor to determine the cause of the heavy 
bleeding. The other causes could be polyps, fibroids or any bleeding 
disorders.
