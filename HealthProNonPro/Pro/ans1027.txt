Red blood cells carry oxygen to and remove waste products from the body`s 
tissues. These cells also contain hemoglobin. A low red blood cell count is 
indicative of anemia. The lower your neutrophil count, the more vulnerable 
you are to infectious diseases. Neutrophils help your immune system fight 
off infections. A low neutophil count (neutropenia) could indicate an 
underlying infection or autoimmune disorder.
