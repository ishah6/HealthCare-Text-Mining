The only way to rule out a fracture or another more serious issue in your 
hip after the fall is getting X-rays done, which I strongly suggest to do. 
If the x-rays come back normal and no evidence of bone lesion, then you 
have an uncomplicated hip trauma and the treatment is conservative: local 
ice the first 24 hours, then hot moist compresses in the sore area, 
anti-inflammatory medication (“Aleve”, “Motrin”), relative rest meaning 
avoid stressful movements and those that reproduce pain.
