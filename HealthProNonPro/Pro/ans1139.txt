Thank you for your question. Eye proptosis is the forward displacement of 
the eyeballs outside of the orbit. Unilateral proptosis is commonly caused 
by the accumulation of lymphatic fluid behind the eyeball resulting in 
proptosis. The accumulation of this lymphatic fluid can be caused by an 
overactive thyroid gland, producing excessive amounts of Thyroid hormone. 
The swelling at the base of your neck may actually be due to a swollen 
thyroid gland. We recommend that you follow up with your doctor and have a 
thyroid function test performed to determine if you indeed have 
Hyperthyroidism.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
