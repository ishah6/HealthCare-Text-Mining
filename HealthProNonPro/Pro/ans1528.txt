There are different types of ear infection and depend on which one your are 
suffering, management will differ. Acute otitis media (AOM) presents with 
ear pain and fever. Treatment is with antibiotics. Otitis media with 
effusion (OME) is a build up of fluid in the middle ear without symptoms of 
pain and fever. this is generally cause by a viral infection and the build 
up of fluid and symptoms usually goes away on its own. If your symptoms are 
due to AOM and you continue to experience symptoms even after 2 days of 
antibiotics, you may need to follow-up with your doctor. In case of OME, 
you will need to follow up with your doctor if your symptoms have not 
resolved in about a month's time. Anytime you have fever of more than 100.4
