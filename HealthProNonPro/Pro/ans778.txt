It is unlikely that the pill is stuck in the throat. What you may be 
experiencing is irritation of the mucosa of the esophagus or even a 
cricothyroid muscle (muscle of the vocal cord) strain due to the pill. Your 
symptoms should resolve on its own and no treatment is required. Drink 
plenty of water and avoid spicy food for the time.
