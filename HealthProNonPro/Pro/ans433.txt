I do understand your concern and although it may be normal to experience 
spotting during the first trimester, it is important to evaluate the cause 
of bleeding further to rule out other serious causes like an impending 
miscarriage, abruptio and placenta previa. I would suggest you to see your 
doctor in this regard. In the meantime take complete rest and avoid 
strenuous activity.
