Difficult in breathing and chest pain could be the result of pain arising 
from heart, lungs, upper gastrointestinal system and chest wall. The 
symptoms of stabbing pain and radiation to the left arm typically points 
towards that of Angina or a heart attack. However having said this it is 
important to remember that similar symptoms can occur in conditions not 
related to the heart as in reflux disease, anxiety or pulmonary infection.Given your young age I would advice you to see your family physician in 
order to conduct a complete physical examination and order tests like 
Complete blood count, lipid profile, electrocardiogram, echo and stress 
test test if needed.
