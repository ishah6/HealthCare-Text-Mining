Enlarged testicles may cause concern in many men. Though it is usually not 
a serious matter, it still needs to be investigated. The cause of an 
enlarged testicle could be the result of a hydrocele, infection, cysts, 
injury, hernia and testicular torsion.With the ultrasound results, the most probable cause of testicular swelling 
in your case would be due to a hydrocele. It is caused by accumulation of 
fluid in the layer of the testicular wall by trauma, infection or an 
allergic reaction. This is a totally harmless situation, and usually does 
not require treatment. If the amount of enlargement becomes truly 
excessive, a decision may be made to release the fluid by surgical incision 
or to draw it out through aspiration.
