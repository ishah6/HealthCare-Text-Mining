Bleeding in between periods may suggest of an implantation bleed due to 
pregnancy, hormonal changes related to stress, anovulation, fibroids or a 
pelvic inflammatory disease. You may have to do a urine pregnancy test to 
determine whether you are pregnant or not. If the bleeding continues, you 
may have to consult your ob/gyn doctor for an internal examination and 
investigations like an ultrasound, hormonal studies, complete blood count 
and urinalysis to determine the cause of the inter menstrual bleed.
