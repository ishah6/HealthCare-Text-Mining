There are many causes of delayed periods. The most common cause of a 
delayed period is pregnancy but since you've tested negative, we can rule 
that you. Other causes are stress, hormonal imbalance, anemia, any illness 
and excessive exercise. Your periods should start once you've completed 
taking meprate (progestin).if you still do not have your periods, I would advise further evalutaion by 
your doctor with investigations like a complete blood count, thyroid and 
liver function tests, hormonal studies and ultrasound abdomen.
