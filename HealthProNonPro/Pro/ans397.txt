I can understand your concern for delayed periods. I would advise you to do 
a home pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy as the cause of the missed 
periods. If the test is negative, I would advise for a period of 
observation. Often stress can lead to irregular periods and usually no 
treatment is required. If you are consistently having delayed or missed 
periods, then you will require an examination and further evaluation by 
your doctor. Blood test and ultrasound may be helpful to rule out any 
underlying problems causing the delayed periods.
