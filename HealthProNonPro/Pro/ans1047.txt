Several studies demonstrated a small reduction in birth weight associated 
with use of marijuana during pregnancy though a single episode of smoking 
marijuana possesses lower risk. Taking alcohol in pregnancy may increase 
the risk of Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS). This is a condition that results 
from prenatal alcohol exposure and could cause defects that are 
irreversible and can include serious physical, mental and behavioral 
problems, though they vary from one child to another.
