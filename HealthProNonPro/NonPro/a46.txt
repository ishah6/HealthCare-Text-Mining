It is a fruit juice from the South Pacific that has a cloud of overblown health claims around it.  It is also tied to a network marketing business that is only a few shades away from a pyramid scam.

When it comes to the actual juice, Im not saying that it is not beneficial to your health.  Drinking fruit juice is almost always better than alternatives like soda.  The jury is still out on the list of medical benefits (curing cancer for example), but what can be said is that there is not a huge amount of medical evidence to back these claims... so buyer beware.
