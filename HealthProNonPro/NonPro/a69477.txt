You have openly admitted through your question that you have ACCIDENTALLY CHEATED on your girlfriend.

You have just combined the two dangerous words tantamount to a certified lie that does not even deserve a second chance. To think that this is the 6th time you ended up in the same situation means you are not learning your lesson.

And you have feelings too? Dude what you got is simply carnal desires with women - no more no less.

It is your moral obligation to be faithful and honest with your woman as she is with you. If you want everything to be fair, then you have no right to be furious when you saw her hugging another guy in retaliation to what you did to her.

Did you have any idea of the guy she was hugging with? Did you have at least the faintest idea as to what they were doing aside from hugging each other? Males can also be good friends to females, particularly to those who were treated dastardly by another guy.

I hate to say this, but being a male, you make the rest of us good guys appear to be shitty with other women whose brain is right underneath your feet. 

I have just celebrated two years with my girlfriend last month, and mind you, we are miles away from each other but constant communication between us ensure that our relationship is stable and that we dont fall out of love with each other.

If theres anyone here that needs to be punished its you and no one else. 

Do you even understand the word KARMA and what it means? That is exactly where you are now hotshot.
