An abnormal blood-work may certainly make a physician suspicious of cancer 
if there is presence of associated signs like weight loss, night sweats 
etc. Blood cancers can be detected by a complete blood count which may have 
to be confirmed by a bone marrow biopsy. Test for proteins and 
immunoglobulins by electrophoresis may help in detecting multiple myeloma. 
Tumor marker tests detect cancers of the ovaries, thyroid and prostate. 
Though blood tests make the physician suspicious of cancer in the body, it 
is only by a biopsy and study of the cell that cancer is diagnosed.
