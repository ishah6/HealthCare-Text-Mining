Weve been happy with Joe Morgensen (adults) and Donald and Laura Stemmle (pediatrics), all three of whom are affiliated with and have offices near Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Gatos.  (My wife very much likes Mary Imig for ob/gyn, too.)

All four participate in Aetna PPO/EPO plans, for what its worth.
