Constant crying in a child could be a sign of colic. Any duration of 
excessive crying in a child needs to be examined. Colic is certainly a 
possibility but other medical causes such as constipation or interception 
have to be ruled out. It may be that some component of the formula is not 
suitable for her system and she is unable to digest her feeds or it is 
making her constipated. The possibility always exists that this is simply a 
growing phase but for pain of this duration, a medical assessment is 
warranted.
