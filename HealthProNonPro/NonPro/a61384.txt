they hurt when u first get them and u may only be able to eat liquids for a bit. youll experience soreness. after a while u sort of forget their even there. in the long run its worth it.

when u get them off they will give u a retainer, its IMPORTANT that u wear them because if u dont, all that time and money spent to get them straight wont matter cuz ur teeth will slowly move back. USE THE RETAINER!!! 

good luck
