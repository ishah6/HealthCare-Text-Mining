For most, the sure fire way to control and/or relieve stress is exercise. But if you are like me and every other busy hard working american, exercise is sometimes not an option.
I used to be able to exercise to relieve my stress, but unfortunately thats just not the case these days. (it sucks getting older).
For me, i use a lot of mental imagery, i read, i have my hobbies, and of course i have my wonderful wife that i can vent to also.
My suggestions is to find what calms you, find what you enjoy, and work towards that at the end of your day. Because of course if you have all that bottled up stress and try to sleep... you wont.
GOOD LUCK!
