There are no medical consequences to taking emergency contraception more 
than once. The hormone contained in the pill is the same as ones found in 
the birth control pill – and that naturally occur in your body. It will not 
have a long-term effect on your reproductive health. You may notice 
irregular bleeding patterns and your period may be early or late, but 
emergency contraception will not affect your fertility, or become less 
effective over time. However, if you find yourself continuously having to 
take emergency contraception, it may be time to reexamine your method of 
birth control. Emergency contraception works well as a safety net, but it’s 
still far less effective at preventing pregnancy than most other methods of 
birth control. If you find yourself in a position where you’re wondering if 
you should take emergency contraception, by all means take it but you may 
need to consult your doctor for other viable long term options.
