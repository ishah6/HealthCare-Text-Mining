I do understand you concern for weight gain even after diet and exercise. 
It is very important that one see a doctor before undertaking any weight 
loss treatment especially if there is an underlying co-morbidity. You have 
mentioned that you take medications for asthma. Your failure to lose weight 
may be due to the medication you take for asthma. Steroids taken for the 
treatment of asthma cause weigh gain. I would recommend that you consult 
your physician for a physical evaluation and workup to determine other 
factors that prevent your weight loss. I do not recommend that you stop 
your asthma medication without the advise your your doctor.Phentermine is a psychostimulant (amphetamine) and causes appetite 
suppression. I would not recommend the use of phenteramine or any other 
oral medication for weight loss in your case. Your BMI is 26.7, making you 
only mildly at risk for complications due to obesity. Medications for 
weight loss may be beneficial to those whose BMI is more than 30. You will 
need to consult your physician and your dietitian to develop a plan for 
weight loss that is more suitable in your case due to an underlying asthma 
problem. I hope the information helps, take care.
