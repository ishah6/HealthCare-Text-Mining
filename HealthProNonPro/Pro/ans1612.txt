Though it is possible for you to get a yeast infection if you`ve had 
unprotected sex, the chances are very slim. Sexual transmission of yeast 
infections is uncommon. Symptoms of male yeast infection includes rash, 
along with burning and itching of the tip of the penis. Since you do not 
have these symptoms, you most probably do not have the infection. Treatment 
for male yeast infection is with over-the-counter antifungal treatment, 
such as Monistat, applying it to the skin directly twice a day for a week.
