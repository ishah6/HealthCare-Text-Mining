I do understand you concern for your wife's health but I would not 
recommend ivermectin for treatment of scabies in her case. Ivermectin has 
been known to cause teratogenic effects in animal studies and safety has 
not been established in pregnant women. It is also not recommended for 
lactating mothers.Failure of treatment could be due to a misdiagnosis, inadequate application 
of pediculicide, resistance or reinfection. Your wife may even try the use 
of 5 or 10 percent precipitated sulfur in petrolatum that is applied to the 
entire body for 24 hours and then reapplied every 24 hours for the next two 
days. It is essential that all linen contacts and clothes be washed in hot 
water and dried in a dryer for successful environmental control of scabies 
infection. I hope the information helps.
