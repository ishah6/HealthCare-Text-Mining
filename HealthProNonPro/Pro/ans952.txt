Pain abdomen and blood in stools could be caused by various conditions like 
a hemorrhoid, an infectious gastroenteritis, diverticulitis, cancer, 
IBD etc. If your symptoms are worsening, I would definitely advise you to 
consult your doctor. A colonoscopy may be required to investigate for 
crohn's which may present with similar symptoms.
