The pain that you are experiencing during menstruation could be caused by 
dymenorrhea, ovarian cysts, pelvic inflammatory disorder, endometriosis or 
fibroids. It would need a complete physical examination with blood-work and 
ultrasound studies of the pelvic organs to determine the cause of the pain.The treatment will depend on the cause. Many women find relief with 
nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofen, naproxen, 
and acetylsalicylic acid (Aspirin). Oral contraceptives also may also help 
reduce the severity of the symptoms. You may need to consult your doctor 
for further evaluation. I hope I could answer your question, take care.
