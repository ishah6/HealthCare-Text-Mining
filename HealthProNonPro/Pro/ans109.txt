Any diet plan promising fast and easy results is nearly impossible to 
resist, and the Medifast plan is no different. By featuring ready-made 
meals and snacks, delivered direct to your home, the plan promises to make 
weight-loss effortless and delicious. As with most plans making such 
promises, however, the reality may be different. As for serious side 
effects, if followed with a doctor's supervision, Medifast appears to be 
fairly safe while potentially effective.
