The probable reason that surgery may have been delayed could be due to the 
development of a localized abscess or inflammatory mass (phlegmon). The 
rationale for initial nonoperative treatment is to reduce the inflammation 
and to avoid the morbidity of immediate appendectomy in these patients 
while definitively treating the underlying appendicitis. An interval 
appendectomy is often performed 8 to 12 weeks following resolution of the 
initial episode of appendicitis in patients with appendiceal mass/phlegmon.
