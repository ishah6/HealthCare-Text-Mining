Meningitis vaccine can cause side effects and for most part these are 
minor. The fever and cold in your son could be due to the vaccination. The 
side effects may occur a few hours, days or weeks after the vaccine. If the 
fever does not subside with acetaminophen, you will have to take your son 
to a pediatrician.
