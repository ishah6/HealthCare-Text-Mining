Go on a NO carbohydrate diet. That means no pasta, no rice, no potatoes. But load up on proteins such as fish, chicken, basically white meats are good. Even egg whites. Eat at set times, 3 times a day. Dont skip meals. And if you do exercise, do it before breakfast. Your bodys metabolism is at its height then. Good Luck!! :)
