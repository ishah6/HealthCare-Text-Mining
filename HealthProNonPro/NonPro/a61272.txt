Having everything and having what you need in your heart are two different things. You cant know certain levels of happiness without knowing the same levels of sadness, because you dont have anything to compare this experience to. And so, it seems dull, meaningless, and you subconsciously try to find something painful to fill that with, so that you can compare and feel happy again. The only problem is, most of those painful things cant just go away when were satisfied with them. We cant find our happiness anymore, and we dont know what to do. We feel trapped, and we know theres nothing we can do or wed be doing it, but we still feel guilty about doing nothing at all. THIS is where the depression comes from. Im afraid theres no easy way out of it, but I can tell you this from my life experience. The sooner you start planning ahead how to get out of the wrong decision you make, the less difficult it will be to really do it. It might take 2 tries, or 10, or hundreds, but each time you try, you get a little closer to making it, and you at least loose the sense of guilt over doing nothing, because you are doing Something. Dont get discouraged. No one can carry you down the dangerous path home (wherever or whatever you feel home is), but some Can light the way and make it easier to see the obstacles in your way. They are the people who care about you. Keep them close. (why, yes, i am really 18, why do you ask? Was I a little to deep?)
