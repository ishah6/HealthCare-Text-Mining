Thank you for your question. Symptoms of appendicitis start off as a low 
grade pain that radiates to the umbilicus (belly button). It eventually 
becomes painfully tender in the right lower quadrant which is exacerbated 
by apply pressure briefly to the area, bending the hip, or rotating the 
hip. One can also have an associated fever, nausea, and vomiting. We 
recommend that if you have any of these symptoms or if your are concerned 
about your abdominal pain, go to your nearest emergency room to be assessed.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
