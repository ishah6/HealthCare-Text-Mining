try getting an oil based lotion and applying it every night very heavy before you go to bed and sleep with it on your face.  If you would like to try a natural way of curing dry skin try olive oil, I know that it might sound nasty, but I have been using it on my dry and cracked hands and feet and it has really worked. All you have to do is get some olive oil and slowly heat it up on the stove in a sterilr pot or pan, do not bring to boil, just get it warm, and then test it with your finger to make sure that it is not to hot for your face, get a 100% cloth rag or towl and submerge it into the olive oil and take it out ring it out gently and put the rag on your face for about 30 to 40 minutes, or you could even sleep with the rag on your face, just remember to cut out 2 holes for your eyes and a hole for your mouth.
