Lactose intolerance is a common problem worldwide, where patients must 
avoid milk and dairy products to improve symptoms. Symptoms in patients 
with lactose intolerance may include abdominal fullness or bloating, 
nausea, abdominal pain, diarrhea, and flatulence following the ingestion of 
milk, cheese, yogurt and other dairy products.Dietetic advice should be sought to ensure nutritional adequacy of the 
diet. Lactose intolerance should be confirmed with a lactose challenge and 
the development of symptoms. There are few guidelines on how to manage 
lactose intolerance but the mainstay of management would be complete 
avoidance initially, for at least a 4 week period, of all lactose 
containing products. Following this lactose-containing products should be 
introduced as tolerated, by individual symptoms and to ensure the diet is 
not being restricted unnecessarily.
