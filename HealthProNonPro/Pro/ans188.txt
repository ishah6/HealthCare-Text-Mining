Chronic hoarseness and heavy sensation in the chest could be the result of 
reflux disease and the acid regurgitating into your throat. It may also be 
due to a upper respiratory tract infection which is causing something like 
a post nasal drip ie mucous and fluid from your nose draining into your 
throat. If warm saline gargles are unable to relieve your symptoms, I would 
advice an upper GI endoscopy and a chest x-ray as the next best step in the 
management of your ailment. Though it may unlikely be throat cancer, if you 
smoke, the risk for cancer is increased.
