I do understand your concern for testicular cancer. Lumps in the testicles 
could be caused by cysts, epididymitis, injury/trauma, orchitis, varicocele 
and testicular cancer.It is important to rule out testicular cancer if a lump is found on 
examination. A family history of testicular cancer, past history of tumor 
of testicle and an undescended testicle increase the risk of testicular 
cancer.Most cases of testicular cancer present as painless scrotal mass and are 
often misdiagnosed as epidydimitis. The other symptoms include fullness in 
the scrotum, dull ache or scrotal pain. Signs of metastasis may include 
neck mass, back ache, unilateral or bilateral leg swelling or an abdominal 
mass. Gynecomastia may be present in 5-10% of cases.Diagnosis and staging of testicular cancer is based on assessement of tumor 
markers - AFP and beta HCG, CT scan of the pelvis and exclusion of distant 
metastasis by chest x-ray and CT - thorax. The diagnosis of testicular 
cancer is based on the pathology.According to the history that you have given, the fact the the swelling 
increases during sex indicates an infection of the testis or epididymitis. 
If appropriate antibiotics is unable to reduce the swelling, I would 
suggest further investigation by your doctor.
