The symptoms that you described in your question may be due to one of the 
most common causes of knee pain in persons of your age group: 
Patellofemoral syndrome or Chondromalacia patella. The pain typically is 
located behind/under the kneecap and often shows during activities that 
require knee flexion and forceful contraction of the quadriceps (e.g, 
during squats, bicycle, ascending/descending stairs or pendants). Pain may 
be worsen by sitting with the knee flexed (“indian style”) for a long 
period of time, such as while watching a movie, hence leading to the terms 
"theatre sign" and "movie-goer's knee." The causes are diverse: Overuse 
(repetitive use or activity), overloading, and misuse of the patellofemoral 
joint. The suggested strategy for conservative treatment should be as 
follows: Physical therapy program (exercises and pain control with TENS, 
ultrasound, ice packs after exercises), anti-inflammatory medication (i.e.: 
“Aleve”, “Advil”), education so you understand which activities avoid 
because those can aggravate patellofemoral syndrome. Also, and very 
important, remark the need for extended adherence to the exercise regimen. 
The physical therapist should educate you about a home exercise program 
Allow time for these conservative measures (e.g.: exercise program) to have 
an effect , usually 4-6 weeks is adequate for some resolution of symptoms.
