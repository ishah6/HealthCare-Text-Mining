I do understand your concern for bleeding in between periods. There are 
many causes of metrorrhagia ( irregular bleeding in between periods), some 
of them are pregnancy related bleed or abortion, PCOS, STI's or vaginitis, 
thyroid issues or irregular time frame of taking your pills and not being 
consistent with the schedule. I would advice you to take a home pregnancy 
test immediately and also consult your GP for a follow up in case in it 
positive, or the bleeding/spotting continues.
