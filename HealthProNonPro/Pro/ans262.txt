Emergency contraceptive pill, is used to prevent an unplanned pregnancy 
after having unprotected sex. It might also be needed if a dose of oral 
contraceptive pill is missed or if the condom breaks. If you have used a 
condom after missing the pill you are protected against pregnancy. You may 
need to continue using the condoms till the next set of pill. ECP is most 
effective if taken as soon as possible, ideally within 24 hours of having 
unprotected sex, however, it works well up to 72 hours.
