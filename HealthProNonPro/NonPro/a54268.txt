Dont even try.  Look more realistically and try losing 12 pounds.  You can do that by first getting up and go for a walk.  Watch your portion sizes and avoid fast food.  Try cooking your own food whenever possible.  Yeah, it might be more expensive, but definintely less expensive then a coronary bypass, joint replacement, or the decades youre taking off your life.  Youre not going to acheive this by yo-yo or crash dieting.  This is a slow process.  If you have any questions, I suggest you see a dietictian or a nutrionist.
