It sounds to me that it is him & his drinking that making him go limp when a man drinks to much they have a hard time staying up so maybe he should try not drinking for a day or so also what he said to you could be taking as verbal & mental abuse you should think about that for yourself & not let anyone talk to like that or make you think that your the fucked up party when it seems to be him and his DRINKING!
