ok is it hyperpigmentation(darkening) or hypopigmentation(whitening) you havent mentioned?? i presume it to be hyper cos u very well know bout MELATONIN ...yes that is the pigment present in skin... the pattern involving nose then spreading to cheeks is rather disturbing specially if you r a female and i recommend that u show to a good dermatologist or medicine doctor it might be SLE but u better confirm first before gettin trippy.... HQ-5 lotion by Debut Pharmaceuticals helps but u must first show to a dermatologist....
