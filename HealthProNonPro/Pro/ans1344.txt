The findings in your mother’s MRI basically mean that she has a small 
vessel disease, chronic small vessel disease arises usually from 
hypertension or diabetes or some other inflammatory conditions of the blood 
vessels. This leads to blockage of the small vessels. The area distal to 
the blockage does not get adequate blood supply and cell death results. One 
of the common manifestations of small vessel disease is the multi-infarct 
dementia (Binswanger's disease). The infarction (cell death) occurs at the 
junction of gray matter and white matter. Frontal lobe is usually involved. 
Regarding the mild cerebro-cerebellar atrophy, this may be related to the 
age. But give special attention to the Mastoiditis finding which may become 
a life-threatening condition if left untreated.
