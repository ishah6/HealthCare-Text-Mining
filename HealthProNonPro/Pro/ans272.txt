Erection dysfunction may cause significant emotional disturbance and loss 
of confidence. The most common cause of ED is psychological stress and 
depression. Conditions like diabetes, high blood cholesterol levels may 
result to this problem as well. Hormonal problems (thyroid hormones and low 
testosterone) may result to low libido (sexual desire) and erection 
problems too.
