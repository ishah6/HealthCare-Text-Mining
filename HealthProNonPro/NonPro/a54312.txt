Since you cant cure a cold you can only treat its symptoms.

For a sore throat and the overall feeling of being miserable try a pain reliever such as ibuprofen, tylenol or aspirin.  Actually since the ibuprofen is an anti-inflammatory it is your best choice.  A warm salt water gargle, hot lemonade &/or chicken soup can be somewhat soothing and medicinal.

A stuffy nose/head is no fun but a nice hot shower or breathing in steam can help a bit.  Try adding some eucalyptus oil to a sink full of hot water and then breathe in the vapors.  Even better... eat or drink something that you know usually makes your nose "run".... like spicy foods, carbonated drinks, hot soup, chili, etc.

Of course if you like to go the drug route I think an OTC store brand Decongestant/Cough Suppressant/Expectorant and pain reliever works quite well.  It gets the job done and wont make you drowsy unless you include an Antihistamine in too.

Do get some extra rest and for lack of a better phrase, "keep your germs to yourself".  You might believe that you arent going to get better until you pass "it" on to someone else but that someone else may just end up passing it back to you!

Get well soon!
