I dont know if my answer will help you any but you have a ton.  First I want to say do not do the salt pill theory.  That much salt is not good for you and it will just make you swell up.  But what I have always heard is that girls stop growing at 16 so you may still have a little time to grow but really it cant be that bad.  Just learn to love yourself for who you are not what you look like!! !!
