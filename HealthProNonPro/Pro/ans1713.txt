Weight-loss programs are generally not covered by medical insurance, but 
please check with both your doctor and your insurance carrier for 
information relative to your individual circumstances. Some policies may 
cover weight-loss programs in conjunction with specific medical conditions 
in which obesity is a factor (such as primary diagnosis of type 2 diabetes 
or heart disease) and weight loss can lead to management or improvement of 
these conditions. But again, you will need to ask your doctor and your 
insurance carrier this question in order to receive an accurate answer 
based on your coverage and medical status.
