I do understand your concern, PID is a complication of some sexually 
transmitted diseases and causes increased distress. Since a previous 
ultrasound was unable to detect your ovaries, you may consult your 
doctor/gynecologist of a repeat trans-vaginal ultrasound or a CT. Failure 
of your symptoms to resolve may indicate an underlying abscess formation. 
Laparoscopic pelvic lavage, abscess drainage, and adhesion lysis may 
sometimes be necessary.
