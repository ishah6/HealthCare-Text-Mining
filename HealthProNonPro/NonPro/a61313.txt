It could break if you punch it hard enough, but if you really wanna do damage to a bone soak a bandage in vinegar and wrap up the arm/leg in the bandage, leave it for a bit (like 1-2 hours) then take the bandage off, slightly hitting the arm/leg (which ever area you bandaged) should break it easier, as the vinegar take the strenght out of your bones. Its scarey actually.
