I do understand your concern regarding your friend's health. Double 
pneumonia is a term used when both the lungs have been effected. I will not 
be able to say how long it will be before sign of improvements are seen, 
which depends on the extent of the lung involvement, the pathogen and 
presence of any underlying co-morbid conditions. I wish you friend well.
