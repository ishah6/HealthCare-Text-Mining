What you may have seen could be adenoids. Adenoids are located high in the 
throat, behind the soft palate. Just like tonsils, adenoids are also 
lymphoid tissues that aid the immune system in fighting infections. I would 
definitely not be concerned of a tumor in this case. I suggest that you 
refrain from smoking as this may lead to worsening of your symptoms, take 
care.
