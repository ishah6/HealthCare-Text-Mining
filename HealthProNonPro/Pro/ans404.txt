I do understand that anxiety and depression is effecting your sleep. It may 
be difficult to treat insomnia in your case without treating the underlying 
problem (depresion) first. It may be helpful in your case to consult your 
doctor and rule out evidence of depression and anxiety which are one of the 
main causes of insomnia. Treatment of insomnia may require both 
non-pharmacologic (non-medical) and pharmacologic (medical) aspects, and 
treatment of each individual varies. I would suggest that you consult your 
doctor to determine wither the use of benzodiazepines or other non 
sedatives may be helpful in treating insomnia in your case.
