Sciatica is caused by nerve inflammation along the sciatic nerve: blunt 
injury, compression by the surrounding muscles, inter-vertebral disk 
degeneration ,fracture or lumbar disk disease, all can produce inflammation 
that results in pain. The conventional treatment for Sciatica is aimed to 
relieve the pain and besides the use of anti-inflammatory. If your pain is 
not relieved by these measures you will need a CT scan to the severity of 
the disease and treatment options.
