The symptoms of pain during intercourse experienced by you and your husband 
could be due to a urinary tract or a sexually transmitted infection. Both 
you and your partner need to see a doctor for a urine test, vaginal or 
urethral swab for infections and antibiotics in the presence of infection. 
All the best.
