The red spot inside your upper eye lid could be due to a chalazion which is 
caused by obstruction of the oil gland within the eyelid. Chalazions are 
best treated with warm compresses and gentle massage. Hold a warm, wet 
towel on the eyelid for five to 10 minutes, several times a day, to reduce 
swelling and promote drainage of the gland. Light massage of the area also 
helps to promote drainage.
