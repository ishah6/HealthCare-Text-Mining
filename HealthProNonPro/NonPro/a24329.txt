Hi..
My first and most important answer for you is NO, it is not fatal. Like any other disease of the large intesting (colon) it can get worse, cause a great deal of pain, bleeding and anemia.

If you have not already done so, get to a gastroenterologist and get thoroughly checked out. 

As we age, our colon can create bulges (sacs) which poke out toward the abdomonal wall. They can be irritated when the rub against the abdominal tissue and can break open.

When they do, you will possibly see blood in your stool and you will have a high degree of pain. Until that happens, there are few or no symptoms.

Rest assured, they are treatable and you can live a normaL life with them. You nay have to make changes in your diet and possibly take medications to control recurrences.

Hope you feel better soon.
