There is no specific normal or abnormal PSA level. In the past, most 
doctors considered a PSA level below 4.0 ng/mL as normal, though about 
10-15% of individual with prostate may have PSA levels less than 4. In 
addition inflammation (e.g., prostatitis), can cause PSA level to 
fluctuate. One abnormal PSA test result does not necessarily indicate the 
need for a prostate biopsy.
