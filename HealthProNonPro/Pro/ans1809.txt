Your description may correspond to Neuralgia; this is a sharp pain that 
follows the area or path supplied by the affected nerve, due to irritation 
or damage. You are having increased sensitivity of the skin along the path 
or area of the affected nerve, then any touch or pressure is felt as pain. 
The goal of the treatment is to reverse or control the cause of the nerve 
problem (if found), and provide pain relief. Treatment varies depending on 
the cause, location, and severity of the pain, and other factors. Even if 
the cause of the neuralgia is never found, the condition may improve on its 
own or disappear with time.
