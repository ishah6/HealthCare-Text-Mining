poke yourself in the eye, its fun.

but seriously, your question is very vauge, so i will just say if you or someone you know is cutting or smashing their head into the wall, its time to see a counselor.  if youre doing it to hurt or punish yourself, its a suicidal gesture that should be taken seriously.  

I think that if someone was doing it for attention, they would put it on display and show a lot of people, going,  oooh, look, i carved a frowny face in my forearm.

If someone is hiding this, then it definatley warrents attention.  Show them love and try to get them help.
