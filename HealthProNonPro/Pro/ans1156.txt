Thank you for your question. In order to determine if a palpable mass 
underneath the skin is cancer, it has to be biopsied and analyzed by a 
pathologist. Not all lumps beneath the surface of the skin are cancer. They 
are often benign (non-cancerous) tumors such as lipomas (composed of fat) 
or sebaceous cysts, which are fluid filled masses that develop from a 
blocked sebaceous gland. Please see your doctor to have this swelling 
examined.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
