It is difficult for me to comment whether you should be taking the three 
inhalers together, this all depend on the severity of your symptoms. Clenil 
modulite is a corticosteriod used to decrease inflammation in the lungs, 
whereas salbutamol inhaler is a short-acting ?2-adrenergic receptor agonist 
used to prevent acute symptoms. Serevent evohaler is also a ?2-adrenergic 
receptor agonist but it usually takes care of long term symptoms. I would 
suggest that you speak with your doctor regarding your concerns about the 
use of multiple inhalers.
