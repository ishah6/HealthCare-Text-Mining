It is important to rule out concussion. By definition, a concussion is not 
a life-threatening injury, but it can cause both short-term and long-term 
problems. Signs and symptoms of a concussion may include: headache, 
temporary loss of consciousness, confusion, dizziness, ringing in the ears, 
nausea and vomiting. I would advise that you consult you doctor for imaging 
of the brain to exclude any traumatic brain injury.
