Try to wear heel-cushioned footwear, avoid high heels, if you exercise do a 
warm up before with an adequate stretch, avoid putting excessive strain on 
your feet and lose weight if you need it. You also may take anti 
inflammatory medication (“Aleve”, “Motrin”) and see if they work relieving 
the pain. You could try applaying local ice in the heel for periods no more 
that 20 minutes several times a day.
