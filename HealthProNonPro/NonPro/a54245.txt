Technically you could survive for 40 days but........I dont recomend it.

As a Life Coach, your feelings about being depressed are what I am more interested in you trying to remove. You probably know why youre depressed, so I am not going to harp on that. But I do suggest you get your mind around those feelings.

Somethings that I noticed from your question are:

Firstly.....you are not actually trying to kill yourself, because you want to know what signs to look for, for when you should eat again.

This then leads me to thinking that you are really asking for help about why you are depressed.

Secondly....I highly recommend that you deal with your food issues. Food is not your enemy, it is your weapon of choice. For some reason you have chosen to not eat, so that you can jurt yourself in some way.

If you are going to try the not eating, just remember that if any part of this is connected to weightloss, then you are more likely to be putting on more weight when you do start eating again, because you have told your body it is a famine, so hold onto everything. You are first putting your body into survival mode, then flooding it with food later on.

Why is food your weapon, when you could choose anything else?

Food is your medicine, you cant go without, and too much is harmful.

Please get some help with this.......go and get help now.
