The most common cause of itchy palms is contact dermatitis. Exposure of 
irritant to the skin cause inflammation and edema. Treatment involves 
identifying the irritant (eg. a new soap, wash, creams or gloves), washing 
the are with water and applying a corticosteroid cream to reduce the 
inflammation. The itching will subside in 1-2 weeks and no further 
treatment is required.
