It is difficult for me to tell whether you have genital herpes or not. 
Since you were having oral sex it is more likely that you may have 
contracted herpes type 1 from your partner which usually affects the mouth 
and oral mucous membranes. Iindividuals with herpes may spread the disease 
even if they do not realize they have an infection. Even more, they can 
transmit infection while their disease appears to be inactive and no sores 
can be visibly seen. Your doctor usually can diagnose genital herpes based 
on a physical exam and the results of certain laboratory tests like DNA and 
blood test. There's no cure for genital herpes. Treatment with prescription 
antiviral medications may help sores heal sooner and lessen the severity 
and duration of the symptoms.
