It could, but itd have to be a pretty hard punch. I got in a fist fight once and ended up with a badly sprained hand, a broken nose and a concussion. The other guy ended up with a dislocated shoulder and a hairline crack in his femur.

This was all done with our fists, feet and heads. We werent throwing chairs or anything like that.
