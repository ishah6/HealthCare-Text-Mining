I do understand your concern of being pregnant but due to the fact that you 
had sex more than 10 days before your ovulation, the chances of pregnancy 
is minimal. I do however feel that the pelvic inflammatory disease could be 
the cause of the pelvic pain.You will need to consult your gynecologist for further management. The main 
goal in the treatment of PID is to provide prompt, appropriate antibiotic 
therapy to decrease pain, improve symptoms and prevent progression of the 
infection.Antibiotics are the mainstay of treatment. Oral antibiotics are recommended 
for mild to moderate symptoms of PID. If no significant benefit is seen 
within 72 hours the treatment will need to be reevaluated.
