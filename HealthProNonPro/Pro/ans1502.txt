The symptoms that you mentioned of chest pain on exertion do seem a bit 
concerning and may point towards an angina. Though pain arising from the 
heart, lungs, upper gastrointestinal system and chest wall may all present 
with similar symptoms.I would still advice you to see you GP for a more thorough physical 
examination including a BP and a cardiac exam , other testing like a lipid 
panel along with a cardiac stress test and an ECG to rule out any intrinsic 
cardiac problem like an angina.
