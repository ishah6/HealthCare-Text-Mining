Thank you for your question. Since the nevus has been injured you will need 
to carefully examine it regularly to make sure there aren't any changes 
that indicate malignant transformation. You have mentioned all the criteria 
namely: asymmetry, irregular border, changes in color or diameter, pain, 
itching or discomfort. We recommend that you carefully look for any of 
these changes on a monthly basis and if you notice anything please schedule 
an appointment with your dermatologist to have this examined in a timely 
manner. As of now, based on your description, observation on a regular 
basis would be suffice.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
