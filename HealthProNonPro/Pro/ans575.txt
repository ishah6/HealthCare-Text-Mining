I would advise you to take your fiancee to see his surgeon as soon as 
possible. It is important that the injury be further investigated to rule 
out injury to the median nerve as suggested by the findings. These symptoms 
may also be present if a compartment syndrome develops following the injury 
which again requires urgent evaluation by a surgeon.
