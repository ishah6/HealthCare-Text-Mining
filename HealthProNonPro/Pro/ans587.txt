I would suggest that you consult your doctor on the use of enemas. 
Constipation enemas are a last resort when it comes to resolving 
constipation problems. Non-prescription drugs should be tried first, 
prescription laxatives should only be used at the recommendation of your 
doctor. Enemas are a last resort, and you should not decide on these 
alternatives unless all the preceding suggestions have been exhausted.
