Experiencing pain after an appendectomy is a cause of stress. In my opinion 
your pain could be caused due to adhesion at the site of operation and is 
complicated with chronic constipation. It may also be caused by something 
that is completely unrelated like an ovarian cyst, pelvic inflammatory 
disease or endometriosis. It is difficult for me to give a certain 
diagnosis at this time. I would want you to consult your doctor and have an 
abdominal examination. Depending on the physical finding and history your 
doctor may order imaging studies like abdominal ultrasound and x-ray to get 
a clearer picture. Increasing the fiber in your diet, adequate hydration 
and emollient stool softeners (Senokot) may help relieve your symptoms.
