I do understand your concern of fear of meeting new people. Your symptoms 
may be due to social phobia. This is an anxiety disorder which presents 
with irrational fear of meeting people or fear of scrutiny and judgment by 
others especially in social events and parties.I would suggest that you consult your health care provider who will look at 
your history of phobia, and will get a description of the behavior from 
you, your family, and friends.The goal of treatment is to help you function effectively. The success of 
the treatment usually depends on the severity of the phobia. 
Cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) is the best initial option for 
treatment. CBT will help you to better understand your problem and through 
systemic desensitization decrease your anxiety level. Anti-anxiety and 
antidepressant medications are sometimes used to help relieve the symptoms 
associated with phobias in more severe cases.
