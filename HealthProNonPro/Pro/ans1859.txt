Your symptoms of premature ejaculation may not be related to your protein 
intake. The most common cause of premature ejaculation is psychological due 
to pressure to perform or stress. I would advise you to wait and watch. It 
may also be helpful to speak to your partner and speak openly about your 
concerns. If these measures don't help, you may need to see a urologist to 
investigate if there is an underlying pathological condition causing the 
premature ejaculation.
