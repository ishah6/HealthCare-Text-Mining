It is difficult for me to say what could be causing your boyfriend's pain 
abdomen and loose stools. The most common cause in my opinion is a viral 
gastroenteritis. Usually no treatment is needed and the infection goes away 
in a few days. It is important for your boyfriend to keep well hydrated 
and avoid fatty meals.If your boyfriend notices blood or pus in stools, the pain abdomen becomes 
worse or he develops a fever, he then needs to see his doctor to rule out 
other causes of pain abdomen.
