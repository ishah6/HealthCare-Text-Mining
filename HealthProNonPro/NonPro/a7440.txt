Dermatitis is caused by an inflammatory reaction so one of the best treatments is a simple hydrocortisone cream such as cortaid.  You can apply this twice a day and it will decrease the inflammation which will decrease the itching and redness.  Try to avoid whatever it is that causes this outbreak! :)
