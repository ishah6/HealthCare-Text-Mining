Lower abdominal and vaginal pain after sex could indicate cystitis caused 
due to mechanical irritation of the urethra after sex. Changing your sexual 
position to one where there is less pressure on the front of the vagina and 
remembering to empty your bladder immediately after sexual activity is a 
good idea. If your symptoms worsen, consider seeing your doctor for an 
internal examination and urinalysis. You might also like to ask your doctor 
about the possibility of sperm allergy as it has been known for a partner's 
sperm to irritate a woman's vagina.
