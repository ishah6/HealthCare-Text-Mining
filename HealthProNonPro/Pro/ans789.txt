It is very difficult to comment whether there is a risk of cervical cancer, 
owing to the wide variability in false-negative PAP smear reporting and 
cervical biopsy should definitely confirm the diagnosis. As for your next 
question, well, it all depends on your preference. Both pad and tampons 
have their advantages as well as disadvantages. If you are using tampons, 
remember to change it every 6-8 hours. If a tampon is kept in for a longer 
period of time, there is a risk of developing infection and something known 
as toxic shock syndrome. If you have menstrual cramps, it is preferable to 
use pads as a tampon can make the pain worse.
