I had braces for 4 years. It didnt really hurt getting them put on, just a little uncomfortable holding your mouth open that long. Each month I had to get them tightened, that made my mouth a little sore at first but after the first couple of months, it didnt hurt at all. As for pulling teeth, that depends on your mouth, mine was too small for all my teeth and had to get 4 pulled. That really doesnt bother me though. 

When you first get the braces on and when they are tightened, you will probably have to stay on a soft diet for a day or 2, I did. Now when I got them that was a long time ago. I was in 7th grade and I am now 34, things may have changed, but I dont think that much. It is worth it to have nice looking teeth.

Good Luck!
