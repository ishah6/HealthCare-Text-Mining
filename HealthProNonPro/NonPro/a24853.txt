While living in Paris, my wife was really perturbed by a constant ringing in her ears, day and night. There are a few books on the market by a guy who succeeded where all the specialist failed.One book you may find helpful is "The Conscious Ear" by Alfred A. Tomatis. Before you do that though I would suggest a total exam by a specialist to determine if you have any physical defects that can be seen.  If not, Tomatis is your man. Good luck.
