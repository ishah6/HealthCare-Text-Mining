Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infection is caused by a 
strain of staph bacteria that's become resistant to the antibiotics 
commonly used to treat ordinary staph infections. MRSA infections generally 
start as small red boils that quickly turn into deep, painful abscesses 
that require surgical draining. Sometimes the bacteria remain confined to 
the skin. But they can also burrow deep into the body, causing potentially 
life-threatening infections in bones, joints, surgical wounds, the 
bloodstream, heart valves and lungs. Both community- and health 
care-associated strains of MRSA still respond to certain antibiotics but 
for that you will need to go to a doctor for culture and drug sensitivity 
testing. Usually light infections such as a superficial abscess, at least 2 
weeks would be needed to clear the infection. Other more complex infections 
may require hospitalization and intravenous antibiotics. I would suggest 
you to comply with your antibiotics and complete the whole treatment even 
if you feel better just after a few days.
