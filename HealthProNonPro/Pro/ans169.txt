Brown recluse spider bites is both cytotoxic and hemolytic and can cause 
significant cutaneous injury with tissue loss and necrosis. More serious 
reactions include systemic bleeding, Disseminated intravascular coagulation 
(DIC), seizures and renal failure.It is possible that the bite would have caused a disseminated intravascular 
coagulation (DIC) leading to formation of small blood clots inside the 
blood vessels throughout the body. However I would suggest that you consult 
your doctor because high blood pressure, IBS and anxiety may be unrelated 
to the spider bite.
