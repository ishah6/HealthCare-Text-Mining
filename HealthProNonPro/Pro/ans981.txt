Pharmatron vitality capsules contain a standardised ginseng extract with 
additional vitamins and minerals like beta carotene, B1, B2, B6, B12, 
vitamin C,D,E , folic acid, calcium and magnesium.Ginseng has not been evaluated by the FDA, so not much is known about its 
long term benefits and side-effects. I may be difficult for me to tell 
whether the drug causes decreased libido, but according to the ingredients 
it looks unlikely. I would advise you to consult your doctor before taking 
the drug if you have any bleeding disorders, hypertension, diabetes or 
heart disease.
