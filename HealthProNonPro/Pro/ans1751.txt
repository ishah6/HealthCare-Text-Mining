Yes, sometimes the bursitis may come back producing a new swelling of the 
previously injured bursa, if this is the case you should follow the same 
treatment as the first episode, meaning: apply ice to the elbow 4 to 6 
times during this first 24 hours for periods no more than 15 minutes each 
time to avoid more swelling, and also ease the pain, if you have any; also 
taking Advil every 8 hours for the first 3 days and then 1 or 2 times a day 
as needed. After the first 24 hours from the fall, you will start applying 
on your elbow warm and wet compresses for periods of no more than 15 
minutes each time, 2-3 times a day, also you can do series of active 
movements of flexion and extension of the elbow.
