I do understand that you are concerned by your symptoms. You do have 
chances of being pregnant. The light bleeding you experienced could be due 
to menstruation or an implantation bleed. Pregnancy tests are however 
pretty standard in quality. However the best time to take a pregnancy test 
is 5-7 days after a missed period as this is when the hormone levels in the 
urine are high enough to be picked up by the test. Another option would be 
to see your doctor and do a blood pregnancy test which is more sensitive in 
determining pregnancy.
