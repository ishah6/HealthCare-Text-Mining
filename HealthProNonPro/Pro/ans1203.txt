Thank you for your question. Prednisone is a corticosteroid medication 
which has a documented side effect of weight gain. There are many different 
types of weight loss supplements, many of which contain caffeine. Given the 
fact that you have muscular dystrophy, we advise you to use caution in 
taking these supplements and be sure to discuss this with your specialist 
treating your muscular dystrophy before taking them. Many of them are not 
approved by the FDA and their efficacy and safety may not be known. We do 
not recommend that you take such supplements until you consult your 
specialist. There may be some prescription appetite suppressants which can 
help you but as a general rule we recommend calorie restriction and 
changing your diet to assist in your weight loss. Please consult your 
muscular dystrophy specialist.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com with your medical question.
