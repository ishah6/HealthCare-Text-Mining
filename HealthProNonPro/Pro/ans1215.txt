Thank you for your question. Since your fiance's symptoms have developed 
after starting his new medications it is possible that he is having a 
reaction to these medications. It is important that he report to his doctor 
immediately to be physically examined and have blood tests performed to 
assess his liver function. Your fiance will likely have to stop these 
medications or have the dosage lowered in order for him to overcome these 
possible adverse side effects. Please encourage him to seek medical 
attention immediately.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
