Though increased fluid/water intake and cranberry juice may help to flush 
the bacteria and decrease the symptoms of urinary irritation, they are not 
a substitute for antibiotics which may be required for a bacterial 
infection. I would suggest you to consult your doctor for a urinalysis and 
culture. Long standing untreated urinary tract infection may lead to 
pyelonephritis.
