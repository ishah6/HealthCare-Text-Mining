Oral contraceptive pills might cause breakthrough bleeding as a side 
effect. This is usually seen during the first few months of contraceptive 
use or if a new pill is started. This side effect might continue for one or 
two cycles and then disappear on its own. If the bleeding increases in 
volume or pain are noticed, then I would suggest you to consult your 
gynecologist for a more detailed evaluation and rule out causes such as 
fibroids and endometriosis. I wish you the best.
