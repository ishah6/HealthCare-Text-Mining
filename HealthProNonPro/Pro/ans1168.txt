Thank you for your question. It is possible that these are fordyce spots. 
Fordyce spots is an enlarged sebaceous gland. These are usually hard, and 
display a similar appearance as you have described. This is a relatively 
benign condition. Fordyce spots can be removed surgically by a 
dermatologist or by using a special type of laser. We do not recommend you 
personally trying to squeeze these fordyce spots on your own to remove 
them. This can lead to infection and unsightly scarring. Please consult a 
dermatologist.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
