The chances of pregnancy depend on various factors. It depends on the day 
of the sexual activity in relation to the period, in your case if there was 
sexual activity in the period mentioned above (28th - 1st) the chances of 
pregnancy are higher. It is not always certain that an individual ovulates 
at the middle of her cycle, so that uncertainty remains. Also factors like 
quality of the sperms, STIs and any diseases of the reproductive organs may 
hamper the chances of pregnancy.Any unprotected sexual activity 3 days before of after the day of 
ovulation, greatly increases the chances of being pregnant. The only way to 
be sure of pregnancy is to do a urine pregnancy test the day of a missed 
period or after 2 weeks.
