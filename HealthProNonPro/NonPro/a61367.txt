the best way to relax is to put on quiet music and either lie down or sit in a comfortable chair.  close your eyes and take a deep breath in then a long breath out/.  doing this will slow your breathing down and help you to relax. next think of standing at a cliff top looking down to a deserted beach of white sand and deep blue sea.  at the side of the cliff there are steps.  imagining walking down the steps slowly one step at a time.  as you go down the steps feel parts of your body lying against the chair/bed.  keep breathing in with long breaths and out with long breaths.  count down ten steps till you reach the sand.  feel the sand under your feet. you see a deckchair next to the water.  walk over to it and sit facing the sea and watching the ocean come in and out. and take it from there
