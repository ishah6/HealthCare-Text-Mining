Switching over to a polyphasic sleep cycle complete depends on your 
lifestyle. I would suggest that you see your doctor for a complete physical 
examination before attempting this lifestyle modification. Keep in mind 
that I would not recommend this if you have an underlying medical or 
psychiatric problem or insomnia. I would also recommend eating health and 
avoiding fat, de-stress by doing yoga, avoid smoking and alcohol (if you 
drink or smoke) and do regular exercise.
