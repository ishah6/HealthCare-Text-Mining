Warfarin is taken to prevent blood clots. There are many side effects of 
warfarin. The more serious ones are severe bleeding, swelling of the body, 
allergic reaction, chest pain and priapism. The lesser side-effects are 
joint or muscle aches, nausea and vomiting, numbness and tingling 
sensation, fatigue and flu like symptoms.Warfarin has a long half life, that means that the drug will stay in the 
system for several days after it has been stopped. If your symptoms don't 
resolve within a week, I would suggest that you consult your doctor. Take 
care.
