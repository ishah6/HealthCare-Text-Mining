....some advice for you,

If the nurse says the injection will be just a "Little Stick"..youd better grab the bed rail because it will be the consistency of molasses and hurt so bad it will  make your eyeballs spin around in your head.

Do not eat the green jello---it will give you such an extreme case of flatulance that you will sound like McCulloch Chainsaw.


If your lunch and supper have a meat with some kind of sauce on it.......scrape it off and check it out before you eat it --sometimes the hospital cafeteria workers forget to take the the hoofs off things.

and last but not least.......do not flush the toilet before you are discharged from the hospital they seem to have a Dukey fetish and wont let you leave until you present them with a doodle.
