Thank you four question. Risperidone is an antipsychotic medication used to 
treat schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and to treat irritability associated 
with Autism and Asperger's. This medication is not a short acting 
medication, and requires some time to reach therapeutic levels within the 
body. Removing this medication while your child is on holiday can actually 
cause more harm but reducing the therapeutic triggering changes in the 
child's mood. We do not recommend doing this. It would be better to speak 
to your son's doctor about changing his medication or determining whether 
or not he still needs to be on medication at this stage of his development. 
Please follow up with your child's doctor for more guidance. Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
