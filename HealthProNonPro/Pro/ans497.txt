I do understand your concern. However, your symptoms of increased urgency 
to urinate is very common in pregnancy due to the growing uterus putting 
pressure on the bladder. You do not need to be overtly concerned unless you 
develop burning sensation during urination or develop a fever. I would 
advise that you take plenty of water to minimize the risk of a urinary 
tract infection /cystitis which is common during pregnancy.
