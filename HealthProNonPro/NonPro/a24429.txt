#1 Get enough sleep with the lights OUT.
#2 Dont tell a chain of lies that you have to keep track of.
#3 Drink some fruit juice and eat some veggies every day; V8 juice is also good.
#4 Dont expect anything to be perfect; when it is perfect, rejoice and give thanks to God, who is striving to make all perfect.  With humans this takes time.  God is patient and made lots of time.
#5. Instead of being in a hurry, try doing things correctly, with quality, or not breaking the law (whichever applies).  
#6.  Follow #5 and you will not have to continually repair your work and the damages from your work.  Jail is even more stressful.
#7. Get some real physical exercise at least three times a week for longer than one hour.
#8.  Some music is healing and relaxing.  Start developing a collection.  You can start with music that reflects the way you feel and then tone yourself with music that reflects how you want to feel.
#9.  Do not become a slave to your desires and wants.  The things you really need are mostly free or very low cost.
#10. Sit in a flower garden when possible and listen to the birds.
#11.  Keep your home neat by not neglecting it.  Best to do the most needy 2 or 3 things on any given day.  Not always possible, but if you let it slide, things will get worse.
#12.  When you are really irritated chop some wood or wash the car, or type a letter to the editor (etc) that is engineered to make things better.
#13 read things like this

#14 Find work that you truly like so that you do not poison other peoples bread.
#16  Treat yourself to pistachio ice cream or strawberry shortcake once in a while.
#17 Drink a full glass of water four more times a day than currently
#18 Avoid people who behave like animals
#19 Make friends.
#20 Get a pet or start a garden (or both)
#21 Pray for further guidance, for your parents, for the world, for those who have much less but are not stressed, and breathe deeply and exhale slowly at least 21 times after your daily prayer.
