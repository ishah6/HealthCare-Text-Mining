Studies have found that MS patients taking high dosages of vitamin D (14000 
IU) suffered less number of relapses as compared to those taking 
traditional dosages (1000 IU). It was also seen that those taking high 
doses of vitamin D did not suffer any significant side effects. In contrast 
to many vitamins, no recommended dietary allowance (RDA) has been 
established for vitamin D. Too much vitamin D can be harmful for people 
with certain medical conditions such as kidney disease. Also your doctor 
may need to monitor your blood levels of 25(OH)D.
