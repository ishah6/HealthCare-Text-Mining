Thank you for your question. There are no specific exercise and diet 
regimes for your body type. As a general rule you need to consult your 
physician before starting any exercise program. For best results, a good 
exercise program should be balanced in weight training and cardiovascular 
aerobic exercise. Furthermore, proper nutrition is of paramount importance. 
Your diet should be free of refined sugars and processed foods, and you 
should incorporate lean protein and vegetables at every meal. In order to 
develop a personalized work out and diet routine, we recommend that you 
consult a personal trainer and dietician who will best assist you in 
developing a plan suits your fitness goals.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
