The normal levels for TSH in a child ranges from 0.7 to 6.4 mU/L which may 
differ from lab to lab. Your child's TSH level of 5.76 is within the normal 
range, so there is no need to be concerned.Usually a high TSH level indicates that the thyroid gland is not 
functioning properly (hypothyroidism) often caused by hashimoto's 
thyroiditis, thyroid hormone resistance or a pituitary gland tumor. You 
will need to consult with your child's doctor to help determine the best 
course of action for either monitoring or treating thyroid function.
