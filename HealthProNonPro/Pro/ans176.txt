Cephalexin is a cephalosporin antibiotic that works by interfering with the 
bacteria`s cell wall formation. Cephalexin is used in upper respiratory 
tract, skin and ear infections. The side effects of the drug include loose 
stools, fever, sore throat, headache, skin rash, seizures, confusion and 
weakness.Since you are experiencing some symptoms that may be due to cephalexin, I 
would advise you to consult your doctor on an alternative medication.
