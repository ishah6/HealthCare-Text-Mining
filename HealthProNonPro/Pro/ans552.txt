I suggest that you have a comprehensive evaluation by an Orthopedist or 
spine surgeon that must include exhaustive physical examination and imaging 
tests, meaning MRI to determine for sure if you are having a spine nerve 
compression that is causing your symptoms and possibly was aggravated by 
the recent car accident.
