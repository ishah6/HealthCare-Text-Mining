They are actually both antihistimines (although Benadryl does come in a topical formula).

Allegra requires a prescription, Benadryl does not.  Allegra has a formulation that lasts 24 hours (the 180mg version); their other formulation (the 60mg version) lasts 12 hours.  I believe Benadryl allergy is a 50mg version (so you need to take a more doses per day for the same length relief).

The active ingredient in each is different as well:  Allegra 180mg (the 24 hour extended version) has two active ingredients (fexofenadine hydrochloride and pseudoephedrine hydrochloride); regular Allegras active ingredient is fexofenadine hydrochloride, and Benadryls active ingredient is Diphenhydramine.

If both work equally well for you, its probably more economical for you to go with the prescription (if you have health insurance) - the co-pay will be less for a 30 day supply than it would cost for 30 days worth of Over The Counter Benadryl.
