A persistent lack of sexual desire may indicate a stress in the 
relationship, fatigue, pregnancy or an underlying illness. I would advise 
lifestyle changes, counselling and using various sex techniques at first 
to see if this changes your symptoms. If you still experience a lack of 
sexual interest certain medicines and investigation into the underlying 
cause may be helpful. I would suggest that you seek the help of your doctor 
in case your symptoms persists. Your doctor may perform a pelvic 
examination and thyroid studies to help determine the cause.
