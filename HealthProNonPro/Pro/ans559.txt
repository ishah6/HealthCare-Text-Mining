I understand that you feel concerned on missing your cervical smear tests. 
PAP smears should be started as soon as women turn 21 years old or 3 years 
after being sexually active, whichever comes first. It may be less likely 
to find anything abnormal if repetitive tests have come back normal. For 
women 30 years and older screened with a combination of Pap smear and HPV 
testing, a positive or negative HPV test can help inform the management of 
an abnormal Pap smear. A negative HPV test, in combination with a normal 
Pap smear, confers an extremely low risk of developing cervical cancer.
