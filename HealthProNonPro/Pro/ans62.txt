According to your description, you may have a strain of the hamstring 
muscles.A muscle strain is associated with the tearing or excessive 
stretching of the muscle and can be equally as painful. Symptoms of muscle 
injury obviously involve pain, however it is not uncommon for the affected 
area to swell, redden and become bruised or discolored. All symptoms of 
muscle injury can range from mild to severe. Any muscle strain or muscle 
pull or even a muscle tear implies damage to a muscle or its attaching 
tendons. The time of healing varies from patient to patient and also 
depends on the severity of the injury. The conservative treatment consists 
of: initially, protection, rest, ice, compression, and elevation (known as 
the PRICE formula) can help the affected muscle and also maintaining the 
strained muscle in a stretched position. Heat can be applied when the 
swelling has lessened, anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e.: “Aleve”), rest the 
strained muscle and avoid the activities that caused the strain and other 
activities that are painful. A Physical Therapy program for 4-6 weeks must 
be followed and practice at home the stretching exercises above all. The 
healing time and conditions for each patient are different. If after doing 
all of the above you keep experiencing limitation of the movements, severe 
pain, swelling, I strongly recommend you an evaluation by a Sports Medicine 
Specialist.
