According to the description of the problem, you seem to be suffering from 
folliculitis. Folliculitis is the inflammation of the hair folliciles due 
to tight clothing, shaving or when the pores get blocked. There may also be 
an underlying infection associated with the folliculitis. Most of the time 
warm compresses and oral or topical antibiotics (mupirocin) help to resolve 
the folliculitis. Take care.
