may produce microtears in the tendons, inflammation and pain , the most 
common of these kind of injuries is called: Medial Epicondylitis (Golfer’s 
elbow) , but by the same mechanism other injuries like this one may occur 
in other places: shoulder, forearm, hand. The healing time is different for 
each patient, and also depends on the severity of the initial injury. The 
suggested strategy in your case should be: definitely review and correct 
the way you are swinging, stretch the muscles of the arms and hands before 
your golf practice, you can use ice packs after the practice to decrease 
inflammation and/or pain, try avoiding activities that reproduce the pain 
and finally, you could benefit using anti inflammatory medication 
(“Motrin”, “Aleve”).
