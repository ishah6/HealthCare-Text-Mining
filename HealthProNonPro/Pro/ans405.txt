I do understand that not getting your periods for 5 months may be stressing 
you a lot. There could be many causes of infrequent menstruation also know 
as oligomenorrhea. Caloric deprivation from any cause such as eating 
disorder or celiac disease can produce oligomenorrhea in adolescents. 
Stress is another factor causing missed periods. I would advise that you 
take a balanced diet, do regular exercise and follow up with your doctor 
regularly.
