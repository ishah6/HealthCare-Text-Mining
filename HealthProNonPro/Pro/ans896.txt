Most likely the symptoms that you are experiencing in your thumb are 
caused by an inflammation of the tendon, the tendon sheath and possibly the 
capsule of the MTC joint due to the extreme forced movement: called 
Tenosynovitis. The healing time depends on each particular case, the 
improvement does not come overnight, sometimes takes longer, so be patient. 
The conservative treatment include the following: avoid activities that 
reproduce the pain (activities modification), apply an ice pack to the MTC 
joint 15 to 20 minutes, 2-3 times a day for the frst 2 days; use of 
anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e: “Aleve”, “Advil”), and splinting of the 
affected finger (if needed). If there is poor or no improvement the local 
corticosteroid injection may be considered.
