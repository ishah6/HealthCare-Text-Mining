ESR is a non-specific marker of inflammation in the body. Normal ESR in 
mm/hr can be roughly calculated from the formula: [Age in years + 10 (if 
female)]/2, therefore your normal would be <20mm/hr, if you are 
approximately 30 years old. It is difficult to know what could have caused 
your ESR to increase. I would suggest that you repeat the ESR in a few 
months to appreciate the general trend in readings.
