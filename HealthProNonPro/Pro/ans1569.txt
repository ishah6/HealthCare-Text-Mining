There is a conventional rehab protocol after that kind of elbow surgery: 
Following surgery, your arm may be immobilized temporarily with a splint. 
About 7-10 days later, the sutures and splint are removed. After the splint 
is removed, exercises are started to stretch the elbow and restore 
flexibility. Light, gradual strengthening exercises are started about 2 
months after surgery. Your doctor will tell you when you can return to 
athletic activity. This is usually 4 to 6 months after surgery. Tennis 
elbow surgery is considered successful in 80% to 90% of patients. However, 
it is not uncommon to see a loss of strength.
