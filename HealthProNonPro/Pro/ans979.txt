Penile candidiasis is usually caused after sexual intercourse with an 
infected individual or if you have a low immunity. I would advise you to 
see your doctor for a physical examination and microscopic study of the 
discharge and culture to determine the causative agent. It is not advisable 
to start treatment on your own.Your doctor may prescribe antimycotics like topical clotrimazole, nystatin 
or ketokonazole. More severe cases may even require systemic anti-fungals. 
Single dose of oral fluconazole 150mg is shown to be 90% effective in 
treating penile yeast infection.
