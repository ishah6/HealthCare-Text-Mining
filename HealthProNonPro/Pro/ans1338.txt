The differential diagnosis of vulvar lesions is large and it is impossible 
for me to comment on the lesion that you have. However, I would advise you 
to consult your doctor to rule out the presence of sexually transmitted 
infection.Vulvar carcinoma is an uncommon gynecologic malignancy and may present as 
vulvar masses of irregular and polypoid shape. These lesions can be white, 
red, or pigmented. If the ulcer is suspicious for cancer, your health care 
provider may take a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis.
