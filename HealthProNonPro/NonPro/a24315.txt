I understand. I get that kind of pain too... what Id advise you to do is to get someone to massage your shoulders and back everyday, if not three times a week. If you cant find someone wholl do it for free, then I suppose you could try some massage parlours, or even the local barber shop! (You could even pay your friends to do it if youre desperate, or pay them back in the form of a free meal) Trust me, your muscles will feel so much better after a good massage!
