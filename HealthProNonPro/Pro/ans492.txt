I do understand your concern. For mild attacks of migraine, Ibuprofen, 
Aspirin, and/or Naproxen may be helpful. If these won’t help, you may need 
prescription pain relievers for migraine (Tylenol #3, Ergot derivatives). 
For preventing migraine attacks, prescription drugs are also helpful: 
amitriptylline, calcium channel blockers, beta-blockers, etc. I would 
suggest you consult your doctor so migraine triggers can be identified (and 
subsequently avoided) and ask for a prescription for preventing and 
treating migraine. I hope this helps. Take care always.
