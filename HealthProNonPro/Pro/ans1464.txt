The recovery time depends on the severity of the initial injury. Many 
people recover without any residual effects, some may be required to take 
anticonvulsant medication to prevent seizures, which can begin several 
years after the original trauma. Short-term memory problems, anxiety, 
headaches or amnesia may also occur for a period of time. Recovery usually 
takes place within the first 6 months after the initial injury in an adult, 
while a child's recovery time is usually quicker. A subdural hematoma is 
the result of bleeding between the brain's surface and its outer covering, 
is usually classified as acute, subacute or chronic and is frequently the 
result of a serious blow to the head. However, it may occur with a minor 
head injury, especially in the very young and in the elderly. An acute 
subdural hematoma is a life-threatening event and more likely to cause 
permanent damage to the brain because the bleeding occurs rapidly, causing 
sudden and intense pressure on the brain. The best way to treat a subdural 
hematoma is to avoid having one. Always wear a helmet when playing sports, 
bicycling, horseback riding or any other activity that could result in a 
head injury. Remember to use your seat belt, which reduces the chances of 
receiving a head injury in an automobile accident, and if you have kids 
always buckle your children in with age and weight appropriate car seats 
and belts.
