According to your incomplete description, I am assuming that you mean the 
ligaments of your knee, you do not specify which part of the knee either, 
but I strongly recommend you to have a consultation with an orthopedic 
surgeon in order to perform a complete assessment of your knees to 
determine which structures have problems and from there proceed with the 
right treatment.
