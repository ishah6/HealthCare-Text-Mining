i used to consume mass quantities of sugar every day.  then my doctor diagnosed me with a full blown case of type-II diabetes.  

whoa!  thanks a lot, Little Debbie!

now, i try not to eat any refined sugars.  the days of the half a box of Little Debbies for lunch are over.  and i cant remember the last time i had a candybar.  i used to spend DOLLARS in the vending machine at work on my chocolate and RASPBERRY ZINGER fix.

gosh, i cant even imagine eating a raspberry zinger now, much less a pack of three.

stay away from sugar.  its bad.  diabetes is bad.  injecting yourself with insulin every nite is bad.  pricking a hole in your finger every morning to get blood to test your blood sugar is bad.

change your eating habits before Little Debbie recruits another sugar zombie to the ranks of full fledged Type II Diabetic.
