I do understand your wife's concern. Tumor markers are substances that are 
produced by the body in response to cancer growth or by the cancer tissue 
itself and that may be detected in blood, urine, or tissue samples. The 
goal is to be able to screen for and diagnose cancer early. There are 
different tumor markers for different type of cancer. Though elevated 
levels of tumor marker may indicate presence of cancer, the markers may 
also be elevated in non-cancerous conditions, thus tumor markers alone are 
not diagnostic for cancer.
