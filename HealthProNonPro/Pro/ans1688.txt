Vaginal bleeding that is unrelated to menstruation may often present as 
spotting of small amounts of blood between periods seen on toilet tissue 
after wiping. Bleeding that lasts for weeks at a time is also considered 
abnormal. In order to rule out the exact cause of your irregular bleeding, 
you will need to have a more detailed history and evaluation preferably 
done by a gynecologist.
