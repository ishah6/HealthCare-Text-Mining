Since your sugar levels are not under control with just metformin alone, a 
metformin/glyburide combination pill can achieve greater blood sugar 
control than either drug alone. Also patients receiving the 
metformin/glyburide pill experience a lower incidence of certain 
drug-related adverse effects like abdominal fullness, loose stools and 
symptoms of hypoglycemia than those treated with glyburide or metformin 
alone.
