You may start taking the birth control pills during any time of the cycle. 
However, if you are going to start the pill immediately or within 5 days of 
the start of your cycle you may not require extra protection, but in case 
that you start the pill at all other days of your cycle, you would need to 
use an additional method (condom) for maximum protection. As it will be 
more than 5 days for you before the next set of pills, it is recommended 
that you take some kind of additional precaution for atleast the first 7 
active pills in order to be safe. You will definitely have a regular 
withdrawal bleed, which should not be of much concern. I hope this helps, 
take care.
