We crave for the endorphin rush.  After eating something spicy, our nerves feel pain. These pain signals are immediately transmitted to the brain. The brain interprets this signal and automatically releases endorphins (the bodys natural pain killer). Once the endorphins kick in, it creates a temporary feeling of euphoria. We then begin to crave for this feeling.  <br />

The endorphins control our inclination toward certain kinds of foods. One of our strongest cravings is for sweets.  Sweets like chocolate causes an endorphin rush.  Chocolate is the most popular endorphin-producing food on Earth. Chocolate is derived from cacao beans that were revered by the Aztecs, who believe that eating chocolate would confer wisdom and vitality. In addition to sugar, caffeine and fat, chocolate contains more than 300 different constituent compounds, including anandamide, a chemical that mimics marijuanas soothing effects on the brain.
