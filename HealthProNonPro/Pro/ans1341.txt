The discharge could be the result of urethritis. Urethritis may be caused 
by bacteria or viruses. It is most probable that the bacteria that would 
have caused the urinary tract infection (probably E.coli) could be the the 
cause of your urethritis, however it is advisable to get tested and rule 
out sexually transmitted infections like chlamydia and gonorrhea which can 
also lead to urethritis. You will probably need a longer course of 
antibiotics and will need to avoid sex or use condoms during sex. If a 
sexually transmitted infection is diagnosed, your partner may need 
treatment too.
