The most common cause of recurrent headaches are migraines. This is caused 
by dilation of the arteries of the brain and the increased blood flow. 
Aneurysms and tumors of the brain may also present with headaches and 
vomiting, therefor it is essential that you consult your mother's doctor or 
a neurologist for further evaluation of the headaches. A thorough medical 
history is required to determine if your headaches are being caused by the 
tumor or if you indeed suffer from migraine headaches. Investigations like 
EEG and CT of the brain may be helpful in ruling out a brain aneurysm or a 
tumor.
