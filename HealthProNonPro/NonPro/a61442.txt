Ana. Forget about your daily intake. And dont listen to the so called "nutritionists" out there who talk about the four basic food groups. These are the same nutritionists who feed people jello and white bread while theyre in the hospital. Avoid all refined white sugar and substitutes such as splenda, aspartame, equal, etc. Sugar, especially white sugar, is deadly. 

If you want a sweetener, use honey, maple syrup, brown rice syrup, or organic cane sugar. And eat a lot of natural fruits so your body does not crave sugar. We are being fooled by companies who make products with sugar in them because our bodies are designed to crave sweet fruits in order to receive vitamins, fiber, etc. And avoid ALL "diet" products. Dont be a victim of this scam. Refined white sugar and its substitutes only leave you craving more. And then youll continue to purchase products that will kill you.
