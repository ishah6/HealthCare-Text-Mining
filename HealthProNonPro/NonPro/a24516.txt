just from my exprience alone i have always had eregular periods and i am 25 and i have a 5 year old and a 3 month old so its realy nothing to be realy concerned about. it happens you should have it checked out for the sake of making sure everything is in order and good to go so that you can start your family but realy dont be all that concerned.
