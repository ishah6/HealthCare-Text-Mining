I think the average speed of an adult walking depends on the age of the adult. Younger adults are bound to walk much faster than the elderly. Here are the results of a study done by the Road Engineering Journal to help determine the timing of crosswalk signals.

Pedestrian Walking Speeds

Of the 7,123 pedestrians observed, 3,665 were 65 or older. Some of the findings were:

    * The average walking speed for older pedestrians was 4.11 feet per second, compared with 4.95 for younger pedestrians. (thats 2.8 miles per hour for older pedestrians and 3.4 miles per hour for younger pedestrians).

    * Older females had the slowest walking speed at 3.89 feet per second.

    * The difference in speed between older men and older women was .42 feet per second; the difference between younger men and younger women was .32.

Furthermore, the average speed of an adult walking would depend on their purpose. For example, while crossing a street, the above rates have been recorded. However, powerwalking through the park for exercise, these numbers are bound to be much higher. There are even going to be discrepancies between someone walking through NYC versus a small town in middle America.

I hope this helps!
