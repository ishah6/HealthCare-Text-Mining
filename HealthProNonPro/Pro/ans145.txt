Blood in semen though common a occurrence may cause significant concern. 
The most common causes could be due to minor trauma to the prostate and 
infection of the seminal vesicles. Most cases of blood in the semen may 
resolve on their own but may require investigations and a visit to the 
urologist if bleeding is consistent. Your doctor may then have to rule out 
a tumor of the prostate.
