Thank you for your question. Mucomyst contains the active medicinal 
ingredient acetylcysteine. This is a mucolytic agent that assists in nasal 
and chest congestion due to excess mucus build up. In North America (US and 
Canada) acetylcysteine in an inhaled preparation is only available by 
prescription from a licensed doctor. You will have to see a medical doctor 
in order to obtain a prescription for a equivalent brand name to Mucomyst 
containing acetylcysteine. We hope you feel better.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com with your health question.
