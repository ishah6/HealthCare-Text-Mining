I do understand your concern. Spotting with oral contraceptives is a common 
problem, particularly during the first several months of use. However, if 
you miss your periods, you may need to do a pregnancy test. Some women miss 
periods or have light periods on birth control pills when they are 
pregnant. If the spotting continues into the next period, I would suggest 
that you consult your doctor.
