A complete or incomplete break in the sacrum is a serious injury because 
it frequently damages important nerves that supply the rectum, bladder and 
genitals. Signs of the nerve damage may not appear for several days after 
injury. In your case, the manifestation of such sign of nerve damage may be 
the constipation. Most likely what you described is called Impactation. 
Moistening and softening the stool with an enema or suppositories usually 
treats impaction. But it is very important that you use enemas very 
carefully and only as prescribed by your doctor. Too many enemas can damage 
the bowel. If the enema does not move the stools, you may need to have the 
stool manually removed from your back passage by a trained nurse or doctor. 
Let your doctor know if you have any changes in your bowel habits. If you 
think you have an impaction, don’t take any laxatives without discussing 
it with your doctor first. Laxatives that stimulate the bowel can cause 
severe cramping and may damage your bowel more.
