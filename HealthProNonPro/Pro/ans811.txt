It usually takes 3-4 months after stopping the contraceptive pills for the 
periods to become regular. I would suggest that you consult your doctor if 
your periods remain irregular even after this time. However you may need to 
take a home pregnancy test to rule out pregnancy, which is the most common 
cause of a missed period. Other causes like stress, hormonal imbalance and 
thyroid disease are often seen in women with irregular or delayed periods.
