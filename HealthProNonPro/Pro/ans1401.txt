The most common mass in the popliteal fossa (the region behind the knee) is 
the Baker’s cyst, also called popliteal cyst, it results from build up or 
fluid distention of the calf muscles bursa. It usually communicates with 
the knee joint by way of a slit like opening at the posterior and inner 
aspect of the knee capsule just superior to the joint line. A Baker cyst 
may serve as a protective mechanism for the knee, when certain disorders 
cause joint effusion; this liquid is displaced into the Baker cyst, thus 
reducing potentially destructive pressure in the joint space. Arthritis is 
the most common condition associated with Baker cysts, with osteoarthritis 
probably being the most frequent cause. The treatment of Baker cysts is 
conservative and includes the use of no steroidal anti-inflammatory 
medications, ice, and assisted weight bearing, in addition to the 
correction of underlying intra-articular disorders. Internal derangements 
of the knee can be treated with therapeutic arthroscopy.
