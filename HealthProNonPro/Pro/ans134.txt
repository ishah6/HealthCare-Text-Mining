Bleeding during early pregnancy may be due to miscarriage and I do 
understand your concern. Many miscarriages occur so early in pregnancy that 
a woman doesn't even know she's pregnant. Most miscarriages occur before 
the 12th week of pregnancy. Though bleeding is sometimes seen with 
pregnancy, it is not common for the bleeding to continue for a longer 
period of time. would suggest first to consult your Gynecologist to rule 
out miscarriage. Your doctor may repeat the beta HCG test to see if the 
levels are rising. A decrease in the level of beta HCG may require an 
ultrasound to rule out a miscarriage.
