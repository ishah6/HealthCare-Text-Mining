I do understant your concern, it is difficult for me to say what is causing 
your symptoms. According to what you have written, we can rule out UTI, 
PID, structural anomalies as the cause of the foul smelling urine. Maybe 
you need to consider your diet or vitamin/supplements that you may be 
taking. The problem sometimes can be due to imbalances in your diet or 
certain supplements that you may be taking. You may try altering your diet 
and avoiding any vitamin/supplements to see if it helps.
