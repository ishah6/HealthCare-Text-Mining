There are many dangers of drinking too much alcohol, and one of the 
scariest things that can happen to a person is throwing up blood after 
drinking the night before. Throwing up blood after drinking alcohol occurs 
as a result of gastrointestinal bleeding. The upper gastrointestinal tract 
consists of the mouth, the pharynx, the esophagus, the small intestine and 
the stomach. The source of the blood in such a scenario could be from any 
one of these organs, and excessive drinking can commonly lead to the 
eruption of this problem. I would advise that you see your doctor sooner 
than later. Your doctor may run you through some tests such as complete 
blood count (CBC), blood chemistries, blood clotting tests, and liver 
function tests. Besides, other tests to be conducted will include 
Esophagogastroduodenoscopy(EGD), Rectal exam and X-ray.
