Tinnitus is the perception of sound in the head or the ears. Often the 
person experiences a ringing, swishing, or other type of noise that seems 
to originate in the ear or head. Tinnitus can be extremely disturbing to 
people who have it. In many cases it is not a serious problem, but rather a 
nuisance that may go away.Because of the vast array of potential diagnoses related to tinnitus, each 
patient requires a thorough history and physical evaluation. The laboratory 
tests for tinnitis include complete audiologic testing with pure tone air, 
bone and speech discrimination scores, CT, MRI and blood-work for 
hemoglobin and thyroid levels.
