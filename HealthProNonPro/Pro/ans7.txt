A clear or milky breast discharge may be a normal physiological discharge 
which is sometimes seen in women. However, since there is a history of 
breast cancer in the family, you may need to be evaluated by your doctor.Although pregnancy may be associated with lactation, hormonal changes, 
nipple or breast stimulation, certain medications and herbs and tumours may 
also lead to breast discharge.
