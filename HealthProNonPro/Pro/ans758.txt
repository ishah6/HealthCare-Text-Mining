It is possible that the pain with the characteristics that that you are 
experiencing is due to an Intercostals Neuritis, which is not a serious 
condition but very annoying indeed and slow healing. By a spasm or a direct 
trauma the intercostals muscles and nerves got injured, and that’s why you 
are feeling that stabbing pain every time you take a deep breath, sneeze or 
cough. The suggested strategy would be: please, try to be patient and do 
not expect an overnight improvement, take anti inflammatory medication 
(“Aleve”, “Motrin”), and also Vitamin B12 supplement. Local moist heat 
helps to ease the pain. Try to avoid activities that worsen the pain.
