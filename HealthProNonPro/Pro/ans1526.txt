testosterone levels :Exercise and weight training stimulates the body to increase production of 
testosterone.Alcohol consumption has been proven to decrease testosterone levels. So it 
is important that you avoid alcohol.Increased stress causes an estrogen surge that inhibits testosterone 
production. You may try de-stressing yourself by doing yoga, listening to
