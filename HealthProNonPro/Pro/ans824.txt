Lime dust can cause serious and permanent damage if it comes into contact 
with the eyes. Lime dust may cause damage to the cornea and irreversible 
damage to the vessels in the conjunctiva. I would suggest that you take 
your dad to the the emergency department to be further evaluated by a 
doctor preferably an ophthalmologist.
