The symptoms that you are experiencing such as weight gain and fatigue 
could definitely be due to menopause. These symptoms are caused by changing 
hormone levels. During menopause the functioning of the ovaries diminishes. 
The ovaries produce eggs (ova) and female hormones such as estrogen. During 
menopause the level of female hormones and estrogen drops causing these 
symptoms. I would suggest that you see your doctor to see whether hormonal 
replacement therapy may be beneficial to suppress the symptoms you are 
experiencing.
