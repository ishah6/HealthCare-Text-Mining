Suboxone contains a combination of buprenorphine and naloxone. The medicine 
is taken sublingually by placing it under the tongue until it has 
dissolved. It is not recommended to swallow the tablet. If you experience 
any side-effects of the drug like nausea/vomiting, pain abdomen, dizziness, 
skin rash, dark urine or pale stools, I would advise you to see your doctor 
right away.
