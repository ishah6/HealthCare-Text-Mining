Though most cases of testicular pain are benign, I would advise you to take 
your son to see his doctor to rule out testicular torsion. Testicular 
torsion is an emergency and requires immediate attention. This may present 
with pain in the testicles after physical activity. Other causes could be 
trauma, inguinal hernia or epididymitis.
