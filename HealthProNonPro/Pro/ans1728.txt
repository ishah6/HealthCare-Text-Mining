When taken properly, birth control pills are 98 to 99 percent effective, in 
preventing pregnancy with no additional precautions. Plan B is recommended 
as an emergency from of contraception when you did not use contraception or 
your original form of contraception failed.In your case, you were on a form of contraception - the oral birth control 
pill. It is quite effective when taken as prescribed. You did miss a dose. 
If you did not make up this dose by taking the missed dose right away 
sometime before your next dose, then it would be a reasonable choice to 
take Plan B. However I would not advise you to take Plan B on a regular 
basis. You may need to consult your doctor for further information 
regarding the use of plan B. Take care.
