Your problem now is that the piece of metal or plastic under your 
fingernail is acting as a “foreign body” and producing a reaction beneath 
the nail in which the debris are leading to a nailbed infection. I strongly 
recommend you to go to the Hand Surgeon specialist before the infection 
gets worse.
