It is possible that the pain that you are experiencing is related with your 
previous history of scoliosis. On the other hand might be due to a 
Intercostal Neuritis.Intercostal Neuritis is not a serious condition but 
very annoying indeed and slow healing. By a spasm or a direct trauma the 
intercostals muscles and nerves got injured, and that’s why you are feeling 
that stabbing pain every time you take a deep breath, sneeze or cough.The 
suggested strategy would be: please, try to be patient and do not expect an 
overnight improvement, take anti-inflammatory medication (“Aleve”, 
“Motrin”), and also Vitamin B12 supplement. Local moist heat helps to ease 
the pain. Try to avoid activities that worsen the pain. Also try to get a 
reevaluation by your orthopedic surgeon.
