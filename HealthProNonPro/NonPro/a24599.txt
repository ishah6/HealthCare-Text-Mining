unless one of you had oral/bum sex with somebody else, or contracted it from another form such as sharing needles, or have a parent with the std and unknowing of it, it is very unlikely for you to get it. But remember it is possible to get some like Trich from just sharing a towell on your privates. But you are not a liar as stated above by another user. You stated that you are no longer a virgin so how can you and your boyfriend be lying about being one. Their response confused me.
