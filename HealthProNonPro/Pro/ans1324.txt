The causes for feeling weak all over are diverse: muscle problems 
(polymyositis, muscle dystrophy,drug induced), thyroid problems, peripheral 
nervous system issues (Guillain-Barre),vitamin deficiencies, anemia, 
depression. People with other symptoms, such as fatigue (tiredness, feeling 
exhausted), sleepiness, will often say they feel weak and it can be hard to 
distinguish some of these from actual muscle weakness. Then, the specific 
treatment depends on the cause. I suggest that you get a comprehensive 
evaluation by your PCP and once determined the cause proceed with the right 
treatment option. Regarding the pain in the left hands and fingers it would 
be important to rule out a peripheral neuropathy and the most common in 
this category would be a Carpal Tunnel Syndrome.
