You have feelings too but "women only care about themselves" coming from a dufus who cheated on his lady "by accident" more than once "6x"?  And you want to discuss fairness?
In all reality, if your lady took you back after cheating 6x then she is as much an idiot as you are. You clearly have no respect for her, yourself or those other women that you sought out to cheat with. I do not feel sorry for you at all.

Quit feeling sorry for yourself. Crying at a movie is an emotional response whereas cheating is a conscious choice. You are vulnerable to cheating? Then you are a weak and dishonorable man.
If you are trying to get sympathy for cheating on your lady for the 6th time and mad that she dumped you, what the Fu*k are you thinking d.i.c.k.w.e.e.d? 
I would beat your arse and then dump you too. Why not run back to one of those broads that you cheated with Smart Guy?
You are a loser! Get outta here!
