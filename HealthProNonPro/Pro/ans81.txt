After have done Physical Therapy, used anti-inflammatory and pain 
medication, practicing currently an exercise routine, going to a pain 
center, tried local injections and neural blocks, well, Some 
antidepressants are useful in treating severe and resilient LBP to 
alleviate insomnia, and pain. In addition, these medications may improve 
your ability to cope, and they may reduce depression, anxiety, or fatigue 
associated with severe LBP. But if you have already tried all of the above, 
and still you are in severe pain and also having neurological symptoms like 
your leg is feeling a burning throbbing pain, If after 6-12 weeks of 
adequate conservative treatment there is poor or no improvement of the pain 
and neurologic symptoms, I would advise at this point, that you get an 
appointment with your doctor and/or neurosurgeon and together explore the 
surgical treatment option to avoid further nerve damage. The surgical 
treatment of a radiculopathy depends upon: pain severity, degree of 
functional limitation and neurologic status, meaning, a rapidly progressive 
neurologic deficit. The age is not a determinant factor for this decision.
