Though losing weight without trying might sound like a dream come true, I 
would be slightly concerned because you've lost more than 10% of your body 
weight during the past five months. An unexplained drop in weight could be 
caused by various conditions — including overactive thyroid 
(hyperthyroidism), diabetes, depression, liver disease, cancer or disorders 
that interfere with how your body absorbs nutrients (malabsorption 
disorders). I would advise that you see your doctor for a full physical and 
blood-work to rule out the above mentioned problems.
