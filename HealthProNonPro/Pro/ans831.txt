Lorazepam is commonly prescribed for the treatment of anxiety, muscular 
spasms and insomnia. Lorazepam withdrawal must be done gradually to 
minimise withdrawal symptoms. Addiction to lorazepam/ativan can occur after 
just a couple of weeks of regular use. Sudden withdrawal from lorazepam can 
be serious and potentially life threatening, and may cause seizures and 
psychosis. You will have to consult with you physician on gradual 
withdrawing from the drug.
