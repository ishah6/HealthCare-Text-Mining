Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.comThank you for your question. There 
are no long term side effects of masturbation, unless it becomes a form of 
sexual addiction which causes a person to neglect other areas of their 
life. It is perhaps unlikely that this is the case with your son. It is 
common to observe masturbation in younger children. It is important to note 
that this is normal and you should not scold or prevent your child from 
doing this. If he is doing it in public, you can discuss that with him in a 
positive way that this is something that is done privately.Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
