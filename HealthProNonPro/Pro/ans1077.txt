Speed is an amphetamine, a psychostimulant, which is commonly abused. 
Amphetamines present with many adverse side effects like disorientation, 
agitation, chest pain, palpitation, nausea, vomiting, increased sweating 
and symptoms of stroke. The drug remains in the system for 7-48 hours 
depending on the urinary excretion of the drug.Since you did not show any toxic features of amphetamine poisoning and your 
ecg did not show evidence of dysrhythmia, only observation may be required. 
I would advice you to be truthful to your doctor, hiding certain facts can 
only lead to more harm. Refrain from taking speed in the future, take care.
