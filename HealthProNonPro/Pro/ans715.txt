It is difficult to diagnose the cause of the itchy pimples on your penis 
from the limited information.If you're sexually active, it may help to get 
tested for STD. Also wearing loose cotton undergarments and keeping the 
area dry will help in most cases. Treatment will depend on the cause. I 
wish you well, take care.
