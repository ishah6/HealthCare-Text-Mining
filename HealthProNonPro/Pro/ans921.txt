Nail bed separation or onycholysis is a common nail disorder. There are 
many disorders that may cause onycholysis. Trauma, prolonged immersion in 
water and overzealous manicure are common causes.Onycholysis may also be present in underlying disorders such as psoriasis, 
dermatitis, fungal and bacterial infection, anemia, thyroid disorders and 
vitamin deficiencies. Treatment of onycholysis depends on the cause of the 
problem. Eliminating or correcting the predisposing cause is the best 
treatment.The portion of nail that has separated will not reattach to the nail bed 
and you will have to wait until the nail is fully regrown for the condition 
to be completely gone. Fingernails take 4-6 months to fully regrow whilst 
toenails may take twice as long.To prevent deterioration or recurrence of onycholysis after it has cleared 
up: Clip the affected portion of the nail, and keep the nails short.Avoid injuring the affected nail, and keep the nail bed dry.Avoid exposure to contact irritants such as nail enamel and enamel remover 
or solvents and detergents.Wear light cotton gloves under vinyl gloves for wet work.
