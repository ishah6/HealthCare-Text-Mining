According to your description, possibly the peroneal nerve was injured, 
and that might be the cause of the numbness, the regeneration process of 
the nerves is long and the healing time is different for each patient in 
particular depending on the severity of the injured at the beginning. There 
is a way to determine the conduction through the nerves, motor and 
sensitive; maybe if after a while you keep feeling the same numbness and no 
improvement, the EMG and nerve conduction study of the affected leg might 
be performed to determine the outcome of your case.
