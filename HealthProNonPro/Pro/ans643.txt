In the view that you do not have history of knee trauma, old or recent, 
then, knee popping or clicking might be due to a muscle imbalance that 
makes your knee cap isn’t tracking properly in the joint. The quadriceps 
(the muscle group on the front of your thigh) is made up of four muscles. 
Your knee is popping because two of those four muscles are pulling over 
your knee cap and one of them is winning. The two muscles causing the knee 
popping are the vastus lateralis and the vastus medialis. The vastus 
medialis is on the inner-front part of your thigh and the vastus lateralis 
is on the outer-front part of your thigh. These two muscles connect on 
either side of your knee cap. In some people, for whatever reason, the 
vastus lateralis gets too strong or the vastus medialis gets too weak. As 
a result, the knee cap is pulled too far to the outside by the overly 
strong vastus lateralis and as the knee moves the knee cap isn’t gliding 
properly in the trochlear groove, causing knee popping, clicking, snapping, 
and other similar noises and sensations. In a healthy knee, the relative 
strength of the vastus lateralis and the vastus medialis is balanced and 
the knee cap slides up and down in the trochlear groove as it’s supposed to.
