Chronic vaginal discharge could be caused by bacterial vaginosis, vaginal 
candidiasis and trichomoniasis. I would suggest that you see your doctor 
for further evaluation. Treatment of vaginitis varies by cause and is 
directed at the relevant pathogen. Your doctor may perform a pelvic 
examination and colposcopy or cervical biopsy if required in certain cases 
for suspected cervical cancer. I hope the information helps, take care.
