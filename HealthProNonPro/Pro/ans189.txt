symptoms. The presenting symptoms are pain in the perineum (area between 
the genital and anus), penile and testicular pain, back ache and lower 
abdominal pain. Patients can also have pain or burning with urination, 
blood in the semen and burning sensation during ejaculation.Nonbacterial prostatitis can be a very time-consuming and difficult disease

alpha-adrenergic blockers and NSAIDS are used in the treatment of
