It is important to rule out as soon as possible a hematoma and possible 
blood clot, occurring due to the trauma sustained that form in the veins of 
the legs can stop the return flow of blood from the legs back up to the 
heart and cause swelling in the ankles and feet. Blood clots can be either 
superficial (occurring in the veins just beneath the skin), or deep (a 
condition known as deep vein thrombosis). Deep clots can block one or more 
of the major veins of the legs. These blood clots can be life-threatening 
if they break loose and travel to the heart and lungs. If you have swelling 
in one leg, along with pain, low-grade fever, and possibly a change in 
color of the affected leg, call your doctor immediately. Treatment with 
blood thinners may be necessary.
