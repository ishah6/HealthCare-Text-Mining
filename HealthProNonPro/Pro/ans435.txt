I do understand your concern for a possible anaphylactic reaction after 
rabies vaccination. Rabies vaccine is obtained by viruses grown in chick 
embryo cell culture. Thus theoretically there is a small risk of 
anaphylaxis in individuals who are allergic to egg, though this risk is 
small as the vaccine contains only a minute quantity of egg proteins. It is 
unlikely that you will have a reaction as you've never had a reaction to 
any vaccine prior to this. However if you are allergic to egg, I would 
advise you to talk to your doctor regarding administrating the vaccination 
under strict medical monitoring where facilities for emergency treatment of 
anaphylaxis is available.
