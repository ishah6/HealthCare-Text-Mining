I do understand your concern for hairloss. It is most probable that your 
hairloss is indeed related to the surgery for bowel cancer. Operation on 
the digestive tract reduces the intake of protein and minerals from the 
intestines following the procedure. The lack of these minerals and vitamins 
make the hair follicles brittle and prone to damage.I would suggest that you consult your surgeon and a dermatologist in this 
regard. It is seen that protein shakes often help in the recovery if solid 
food are not tolerated.
