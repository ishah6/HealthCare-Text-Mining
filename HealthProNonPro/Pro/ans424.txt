I do understand you concern over long term use of nexium. The drug is a 
proton pump inhibitor used in the treatment of erosive gastritis, reflux 
disease, H. pylori infection and prevention of NSAID induced gastric ulcers.Long-term therapy with nexium may lead to an increase risk of developing 
atrophic gastritis and osteoporosis-related bone fractures of the hip, 
spine and wrist. If you continue with long term use of nexium, I would 
advise that you regularly follow up with your doctor and use vitamin D and 
calcium supplementation to reduce the risk of fractures.
