Thank you for your question. Your recurrent UTIs is not likely to be 
related to your partner's pilonidal cyst exacerbation. Recurrent UTIs can 
be caused by hormonal fluctuations associated with oral contraceptives, 
poor hygiene, changes in pH of the vaginal canal, or unprotected sexual 
intercourse. Since you have had these recurrent UTIs for some time, it 
would be wise to consult a specialist such as a gynecologist or urologist 
to further investigate into the actual cause of these infections. Please be 
advised, that recurrent UTIs, if left untreated, can result in infection of 
the uterus and surrounding structures. This can result in a condition known 
as pelvic inflammatory disease. This is a serious medical condition which 
requires aggressive treatment with antibiotics. Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com with your medical query.
