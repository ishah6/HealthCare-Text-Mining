In my opinion, the most probable cause of pain while opening your mouth 
could be due to a temporomandibular joint dysfunction. The causes of TMJ 
dysfunction are uncoordinated joint movements, teeth grinding, clenching 
the jaw, osteoarthritis and trauma to the joint. Treatment, involves use of non steroidal anti-inflammatory analgesics, 
application of warm compresses on the area of pain, jaw exercises by 
opening and closing of mouth. If the pain does not decrease after these 
measures, you may need to see your doctor/dentist for further evaluation 
and management.
