Finpecia (finasteride) is a drug that is used in the treatment of benign 
prostatic hypertrophy and male pattern baldness. Side effects of 
finasteride include impotence and abnormal ejaculation. In most cases these 
side effects resolve after stopping the drug. Since your symptoms have been 
more than 7 months, I would advise you to see a urologist for further 
evaluation and tests.
