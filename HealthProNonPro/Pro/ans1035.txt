Rheumatic heart disease is a serious complication post rheumatic fever. I 
do understand your problem. As many as 30-40% of patients with rheumatic 
fever develop some form of cardiac manifestation of the disease like 
pancarditis, valve insufficiency, heart failure and pericarditis. Chronic 
disease may present with valve stenosis, regurgitation, arrhythmia and 
ventricular dysfunction.You definately have symptoms that suggest of a cardiac involvement. 
Symptoms like heaviness of chest, breathlessness, swelling of hand and 
feet, irregular heartbeat all suggest a cardiac involvement.I would suggest that you consult you doctor. An electrocardiogram, ECHO 
chest x-ray and complete blood workup may be required to see the extent of 
the disease. Treatment will depend on the severity of the presenting 
complaints and the disease.
