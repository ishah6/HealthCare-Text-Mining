I do understand your concern, pregnancy loss is a heart- wrenching 
experience for you and your family. Most spontaneous miscarriages are 
caused by a congenital abnormality. Recurrent miscarriage may result from 2 
types of chromosomal abnormalities: i) a recurrence of abnormility of the 
embryo which is not usually inherited and iii) a structural abnormality 
that is passed on from the parent.You have mentioned that you were tested positive for TORCH infection ( 
TOxoplasmosis, Rubella, Cytomegalovirus and Herpes). This may be a cause 
for your miscarriage. However you will have to consult your doctor to rule 
out other causes of miscarriage such as : chromosomal abnormalities, 
hormonal imbalance, polycystic ovary syndrome, SLE, antiphospholipid 
antibodies, chronic illness and problems with the uterus. Blood tests like 
serum progesterone, thyroid levels, VDRL, lupus anticoagulant, karyotype, 
hysterosalpingogram or hysteroscopy may be required to determine the cause 
of miscarriage. I hope I could answer your question, I wish you well.
