No one can "Punch" a normal full grown adult hard enough to break the "large" bones in our body. The force required can not be generated by a Human being. 

You can break the Jaw bone or Rib bones and other minor bones in the body with a punch but breaking a thigh bone or arm bones takes 12,000 to 18000+ psi and Humans can not generate that much force with a punch.
