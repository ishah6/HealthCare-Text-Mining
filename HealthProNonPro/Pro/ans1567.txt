There could be several reasons for experiencing symptoms of flu even after 
receiving a flu shot.i) It usually takes 2-4 weeks for immunity to develop after getting the 
vaccination. If you get flu within 2-4 weeks after a flu shot, you most 
probably would have been exposed to the virus before developing immunity to 
it.ii) The flu vaccine will protect you from infection with influenza A and 
influenza B viruses, however they will not protect you from other viruses 
that cause similar flu-like symptoms. There are no vaccines or medications 
that can prevent general flu-like illnesses.You may take pain and fever medications like tylenol, advil or motrin to 
relieve the symptoms. If you are experiencing multiple symptoms, you can 
also take a combination medication like NyQuil cold & flu or aleve cold and 
sinus. Also remember to wash your hands frequently with soap or sanitizers, 
cover your cough with the arm, not the hands and take adequate rest and 
hydrate yourself. I wish you both a prompt recovery.
