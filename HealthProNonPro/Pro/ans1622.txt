Though the chances of your girlfriend being pregnant are less, however I 
would advise a home pregnancy test to confirm pregnancy. You have also 
mentioned that she is having a vaginal discharge which could be a sign of 
bacterial vaginosis. Your girlfriend will have to consult with her doctor 
and get a microscopic evaluation of the discharge to rule out infection. 
She will have to take antibiotics in the presence of infection.
