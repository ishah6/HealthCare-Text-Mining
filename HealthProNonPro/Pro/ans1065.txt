Skin tags are not usually know to occur in the vagina or moist mucosal 
areas. It is difficult for me to comment at this time. From your 
description it looks more like an abscess to me. I would advise you to 
consult with your doctor. An abscess may require antibiotics and drainage. 
Hope this helps.
