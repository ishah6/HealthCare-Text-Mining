Chronic ankle pain due to a unresolved severe ankle sprain, meaning that 
by the time when you had the injury, maybe you had lack of appropriate and 
early immobilization, lack of timely prescribed mobility and strengthening 
exercises, the development of scar tissue in the ligaments affected, or too 
much time immobilized. All these mentioned factors are cause of Chronic 
Ankle pain and instability. Sometimes the use of orthotics that correct the 
Hyperpronation of the ankle (ankle with tendency to be inwards) is useful 
in relieving the symptoms (pain and inflammation) in the chronic and 
unresolved ankle sprains. If this does not work, further evaluation, 
meaning local exam in terms of checking ankle stability and imaging, MRI, 
to see integrity of the ligaments are required to determine the right 
treatment option. If there are no ligamentous tears, you could still use 
some physical therapy treatment sessions to control pain and swelling that 
include: ultrasound, whirpool baths, ice and heat and active exercises to 
strengthening the ankle muscles, it helps also tape the ankle and begin the 
weight bearing progressively, as long as you do not feel pain or 
discomfort. But if there are ligamentous tears seen in the MRI and mayor 
ankle instability, then the surgery may be considered.
