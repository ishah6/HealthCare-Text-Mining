You are most likely experiencing a De Quervain tenosynovitis, which is an 
inflammation of the tendons in the first dorsal compartment of the wrist. 
It is considered a Repetitive stress injury (RSI), this happen when too 
much stress is placed on a part of the body, resulting in inflammation 
(pain and swelling), muscle strain, or tissue damage. This stress generally 
occurs from repeating the same movements over and over again; with no 
enough healing time. In any activity in which you exceed the guidelines 
and your own limits or capacities you are at risk of developing RSI. The 
healing time is different for each patient, and also depends on the 
severity of the initial injury. Conservative treatment for this condition 
includes: rest (you need healing time!), ice, stretching and strengthening 
exercises, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory meds (“motrin”, “aleve”), and 
immobilization of the thumb. If these measures fail, studies have proven 
the efficacy of local steroid injections in treating the condition. 
However, if symptoms recur or do not resolve after 2 injections, surgical 
consultation is indicated.
