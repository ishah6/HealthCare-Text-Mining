Most girls will experience their first periods within about a year after 
beginning their growth spurt. Puberty starts when extra amounts of 
chemicals called hormones start to be produced in the body. These hormones 
guide the changes that take place in the body. As well as causing physical 
changes these hormones also cause emotional changes. Most girls will have 
their first period between the ages of 11 and 14. But some girls will start 
as early as 8, whilst others may be as late as 17. Some girls get a white 
stain in their underwear before they have their first period, and this 
means that they may start getting periods soon. But it is difficult to know 
when a girl's first period will happen because everyone is different.
