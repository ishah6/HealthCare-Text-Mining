This is to expand on another persons answer, which was correct but missing some important steps or explanation.  This cure is a bonafide medical and scientific cure.  The get rid of hiccups, you must deprive oxygen from the muscle that is causing hiccups. No oxygen to that muscle, it cant burn energy, no energy, no hiccups.

So what needs to be done is to simulate DROWNING.  We must trick the body to think it is drowning.  This will cause it to divert oxygen from unimportant parts of the body, like that muscle causing hiccups, to more important parts like the heart, the brain, the organs, etc.  

So...take a glass of water, slowly exhale.  Pinch your nose.  Take about 5 or 6 sips of water (or more until you cant take it any longer) from the glass...making sure you are taking in WATER ONLY. Do NOT sip any air along with the water.  Stop.  

Hold your breath for a few seconds, and inhale slowly. The hiccups should disappear. If not repeat.  

I have found this works 90% of the time.  It only fails to work if there really is something stuck in your throat that really needs to be expelled by hiccups or coughing, or drinking lots of water.
