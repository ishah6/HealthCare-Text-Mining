Pinworm infection is acquired by ingestion of pinworm eggs through 
contaminated food, drink or fingers. Symptoms of pinworm infection may 
include itching of the anal or vaginal area and intermittent abdominal pain 
and nausea. Since you do not have the above mentioned symptoms, it is 
unlikely you have pinworm infection. Constipation can be relieved by 
increasing the fiber in your diet. These can be wholegrain breakfast 
cereals, vegetables – particularly if the skins are eaten, wholemeal flour, 
beans, lentils and peas. Drink plenty of water and keep well hydrated. 
Severe symptoms may require medication over-the-counter laxatives like 
metamucil, bisacodyl, magnesium sulphate or a stool softener.
