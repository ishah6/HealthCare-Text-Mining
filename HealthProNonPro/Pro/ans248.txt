Due to the extreme movement that you described most likely you are having 
now an Intercostal Neuritis. This is not a serious condition but very 
annoying indeed and slow healing. By a spasm or a direct trauma the 
intercostals muscles and nerves got injured, and that’s why you are feeling 
that stabbing pain every time you take a deep breath, sneeze or cough. The 
suggested strategy would be: please, try to be patient and do not expect an 
overnight improvement, take anti inflammatory medication (“Aleve”, 
“Motrin”), and also Vitamin B12 supplement. Local moist heat helps to ease 
the pain. Try to avoid activities that worsen the pain.
