Most likely the symptoms that you are experiencing in your thumb are 
caused by an inflammation of the tendon, the tendon sheath and possibly the 
capsule: called Tenosynovitis. Often there is a history of recent trauma or 
repetitive use (overuse) of the affected finger. This type of tenosynovitis 
most commonly affects the thumb or ring finger. The healing time depends on 
each particular case, the improvement does not come overnight, sometimes 
takes longer, so be patient. The conservative treatment include the 
following: avoid activities that reproduce the pain (activities 
modification), use of anti-inflammatory drugs (i.e: “Aleve”, “Advil”), and 
splinting of the affected finger (if needed). If there is poor or no 
improvement the local corticosteroid injection may be considered.
