i think legalize it (completely) for adults over 18.
it would reduce BILLIONS spent on drug wars on marijuana. it would reduce crime and death rates in areas where gangs have territories for marijuana sale.
it would generate BILLIONS and more likely TRILLIONS of  dollars in taxes and domestic revenue for companies in the USA.

right now its californias biggest cash crop by almost twice as much. grapes make 2billion a year. marijuana makes almost 4 billion (estimated. theres no way you can track it)

it is not addictive, and is someones choice to smoke. ofcourse all the secondhand smoking laws would apply (like in california you cant smoke in a restauruant) and you couldnt drive high. theres really no reason NOT to legalize it. if not, people will just get it and do it anyway, and on top of that, people will die due to related crime, and billions will be spent stopping it (which doesnt work) instead of helping your community, which i would rather have.

i dont have california spending billions on marijuana. id rather them spend it on teaching and municpal workers.
