Thank you for your question. Lotriderm cream contains two active 
ingredients, betamethasone and clotrimazole. The betamethasone component of 
this cream may assist in your rash but the antifungal component 
(clotrimazole) many not be necessary. You are better off using a plane 
corticosteroid cream prepared especially for the face. This can be obtained 
by prescription specially formulated for the sensitive skin of the face. 
Please see your doctor or dermatologist to have this evaluated.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
