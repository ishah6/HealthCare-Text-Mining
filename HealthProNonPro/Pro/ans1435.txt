The pain in your spine and shoulder as you described it might be due to a 
cervical nerve compression, but it would be important to rule out also an 
inflammation of the peripheral nerves at the level of the arm and hand. In 
the younger patients, cervical radiculopathy may be a result of a disc 
herniation or an acute injury causing impingement of a nerve. In the older 
patient, cervical radiculopathy is often a result of spinal canal narrowing 
from bone (osteophyte) formation, decreased disc height and degenerative 
changes due to aging process. The treatment strategy usually includes: 
physical therapy program aimed to reduce pain and inflammation, and the use 
of anti-inflammatory medication (as “Motrin”, “Aleve”), also a re-education 
of your habits and posture, you should be independent in a stretching and 
strengthening program and continue with these exercises under the periodic 
supervision of a physical therapist initially and then completely on your 
own. Often, you should show progressive improvement over the first 6-8 
weeks with conservative treatment. If there is no significant improvement 
in this time frame, consider a surgical evaluation.
