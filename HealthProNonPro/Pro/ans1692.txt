Vaginal discharge that is clear and non foul smelling is usually a normal 
vaginal discharge. An irritation of change in the smell of the discharge 
could indicate bacterial vaginosis is requires further evaluation. I 
recommend visiting a doctor anytime your discharge is different from usual. 
Antibiotics like metronidazole and clindamycin are affective in bacterial 
vaginosis.
