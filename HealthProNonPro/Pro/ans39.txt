Abnormal bleeding that is unrelated to the normal period may present with 
spotting of small amounts of blood between periods or a heavy bleed. 
Bleeding that lasts for weeks at a time is also considered abnormal. In 
order to rule out the exact cause of your irregular bleeding, you will need 
to have a more detailed history and evaluation preferably done by a 
gynecologist.
