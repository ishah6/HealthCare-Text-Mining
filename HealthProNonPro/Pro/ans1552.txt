There are no studies yet which prove a definite interaction between diet 
pills and oral contraceptives. Given the fact that diet pills tend to speed 
up the metabolism, which causes birth control doses to break down earlier 
than usual, it hasn’t been confirmed as such that diet pills decrease the 
effectiveness of birth control pills. However, you should be careful when 
you purchase diet pills as the market is full of anti-obesity drugs. 
Xenical (Orlistat) is the only weight loss drug approved by the Food and 
Drugs Administration (FDA). Diet pills can cause some side effects at 
times, like diarrhea or vomiting. In such cases, your birth control pill 
will be expelled before it is absorbed in the body. Therefore, it is 
necessary to speak to your gynecologist about the right diet pill for your 
body that does not have adverse reactions on your birth control measures.
