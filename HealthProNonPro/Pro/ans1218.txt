Thank you for your question. Swelling can indeed obstruct the visualization 
of fractures on x-ray so it is very important that you have your forearm 
reevaluated with a physical examination and diagnostic imaging in order to 
determine the extent of the damage. Damage to the tendons/ligaments would 
cause decreased ability to move the arm, hand and fingers. The numbness ant 
tingling you are feeling could be due nerve damage which can take many 
months to heal or remain permanently damaged. We are unable to determine 
how long it will take your arm to heal because we are not certain as to how 
severe the damage is. Once diagnosed the appropriate treatment and 
physiotherapy (if necessary) will be recommended in order to treat your arm 
pain.
