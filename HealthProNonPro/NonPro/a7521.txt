This is most likely a humidity problem. You need to get some sort of long term moisture either in your nose, or in your homes air. One of the easiest ways to moisturize anything in your body (skin, hair, organ tissue, as well as at the cell level, and keeping your system detoxed) is by drinking WATER. Hydration helps prevent anything caused by low humidity...chapped lips, nosebleeds, etc.

Moisturizers (balms, creams, lotions) that contain oil work on the premise that oil and water dont mix. They provide a barrier on the skin which keeps WATER from evaporating off the skin, it is the WATER that your skin needs, not the oil. 

My guess is if you have tried these things, you didnt give the moisture a chance to improve your situation.
Other causes for nosebleeds:

The joke about cocaine wasnt very funny but if you have ever snorted anything before, you may have damaged your nasal membranes, if you are using now, that is another reason for the nosebleeds.

I dont know much about allergies either, could there be something in your air that you are allergic to? Even if you are not sneezing, etc you could be exposing yourself and your nasal passages to something they dont like, and sneezing if you have that, is a pretty harsh experience for the nose, the contraction of tissues, etc. Then you wipe your nose or blow it manually and may be scratching the skin. 

If you have a sinus infection, you can get a nosebleed. Also if you have a cold and get a really bad crusty booger in there then get it out, you can cut your nose with it. Sorry there is no polite way to say that and I dont mean to be gross.

Also stay away from any blood thinners if you can help it, classic is aspirin...are you taking any new medications that have anti-coagulation side effects? Blood thinners make bruises, wounds, menstrual periods, and nosebleeds worse.
