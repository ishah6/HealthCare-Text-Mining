You might be experiencing a mechanical upper back pain, produced by the 
straining of that segment of the spine, you probably are not stretching 
adequately before beginning your physical activities and this adds more 
stress to an affected area not totally healed. Also sometimes the muscles 
tend to contract during the sleep for the tension or stress during the day. 
You should revise your sleeping habits, and how relax you are when the 
bedtime comes.The conservative treatment of the upper back pain is 
basically relative rest of the spinal segment involved, avoiding all the 
activities that produce pain or discomfort, such as weight lifting. Also 
very important is the reeducation to keep a good posture at all times. 
Control of the pain and inflammation with Ice, transcutaneous electrical 
nerve stimulation (TENS), and anti-inflammatory drugs (such as ibuprofen). 
Keep a consistent exercise routine with stretching and extension-flexion 
which may reduce tension and stress to the spinal joints. A home program is 
developed within the tolerance and ability in order to encourage continued 
exercise.
