Your back pain could be caused by injury to the muscles, bones, and/or 
nerves of the spine, disc herniation that produces irritation of the nerve 
(i.e.: sciatica), spinal stenosis, deformities of the spine (i.e.: 
scoliosis, kyphosis), fibromyalgia. The treatment strategy usually 
includes: rest, physical therapy program aimed to reduce pain and 
inflammation, and the use of anti-inflammatory medication. If there is a 
poor response to these measures then you may need to consult an orthopedic 
surgeon.
