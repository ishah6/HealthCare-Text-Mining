I do understand that you would like to try the medication for acne that is 
improving your friend's symptoms. Acne present differently is every 
individual and what may work for one may not necessarily work for the other.The treatment of acne depends of the type of acne (i.e. whether it is a 
non-inflamed comedone or an inflamed comedone) and also the grade of the 
acne. You will require to see your doctor or a dermatologist for 
appropriate treatment of acne that is suitable for your skin. Take care.
