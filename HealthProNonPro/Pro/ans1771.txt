You do seem to be having a viral upper respiratory tract infection which 
will run its own course. For your sore throat i would advice some soothing 
lozenges, saline/salt water gargling, hot fluids like soups etc which will 
help soothing the inflammation. If you are not coughing out yellowish 
phlegm, you can just increase fluid intake, take over-the-counter cough 
suppressants (Robitussin) and have more citrus fruits. In case the symptoms 
don't subside or get better in a week then please see your physician for a 
follow up.
