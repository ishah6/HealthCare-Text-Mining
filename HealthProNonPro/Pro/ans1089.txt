Sutures are divided into two categories, absorbable and nonabsorbable 
sutures. The absorbable sutures breakdown in the body and lose their 
strength within 60 days whereas the nonabsorbable sutures maintain their 
strength for longer than 60 days.Depending of the sutures used and the site of the sutures, the removal time 
varies. Usually sutures on the trunk and body are removed after 7 to 10 
days. You may have to consult with your doctor to find the reason for 
keeping the sutures longer.
