Thank you for your question. Nyquil is a brand name cold symptom relief 
medication that contains four medications: acetaminophen, dextromethorphan, 
doxylamine, pseudoephedrine. What concerns us the most is the interaction 
of dextromethorphan in Nyquil and your current medication Fluoxetine. When 
these two medications are combined a rare but serious condition called the 
serotonin syndrome can occur. The symptoms of Serotonin Syndrome include 
extreme fluctuations in blood pressure, seizures, hallucinations, increased 
heart rate, sweating, fever, muscle spasms, vomiting nausea, and a host of 
other symptoms. The most severe cases can result in coma and death. Please 
consult your doctor before taking Nyquil while on fluoxetine. Thank you for choosing AskTheDoctor.com
