In my opinion the world is made up of three aspects, body, mind and soul. In order to be truely happy you must find balance in all three.

If youre good at winning fights thenId say your body is healthy, if youve got lots of friends then your soul is refreshed, but if you have no mental balance then depression will still affect you.

Different people use different methods to achieve balance, be it religion, sports activities, pub quizzes, all you need to do is to find those activities that keep you stimulated in all fields of your life.
