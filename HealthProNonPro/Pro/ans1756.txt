You are likely suffering from menstrual cramps of Dysmenorrhea. There are 
two types of Dysmenorrhea. Primary Dysmenorrhea is where there is no 
underlying gynecological cause of pain and Seccondary Dysmenorrhea where 
some underlying gynecological condition is the cause of the pain.I would advise you to see her doctor for a complete physical examination 
and tests to rule out endometriosis, adenomyosis, ovarian cyst, uterine 
polyps and adhesion which may present with uterine pain. Drugs include 
Paracetamol (Tylenol) or Ibuprofen (Advil) or Naproxen (Aleve) can be taken 
if the pain becomes severe.
