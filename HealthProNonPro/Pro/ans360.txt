Heavy bleeding during periods is known as menorrhagia. This usually happens 
when there is imbalance in the hormones estrogen and progesterone. This 
worsens with increase of age. The other causes could be polyps, fibroids or 
any bleeding disorders.I would advise that you consult your gynecologist for a complete physical 
examination. Blood work like a complete blood count, iron studies, 
coagulation factors, thyroid function tests, prolactin levels, hormone 
assays and liver function test may be ordered by your doctor to determine 
the cause of the heavy bleeding. Other tests may include imaging studies 
like ultrasound, CT scan of the pelvis and PAP smear.
