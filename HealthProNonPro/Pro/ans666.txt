Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a gastrointestinal disorder characterized 
by chronic abdominal pain and altered bowel habits in the absence of any 
organic disorder. IBS is a chronic condition with no known cure. As a 
result, the focus of treatment should be on relief of symptoms and in 
addressing the patient's concerns. A careful dietary history may reveal 
patterns of symptoms related to specific foods. A number of dietary 
interventions have been proposed but their efficacy has not been well 
established.Given the similarity that may occur in symptoms of IBS and lactose 
intolerance, an empiric trial of a lactose free diet should be considered 
in patients suspected of having irritable bowel syndromeExclusion of foods that increase flatulence (beans, onions, celery, 
carrots, raisins, bananas, apricots, prunes, brussel sprouts, wheat germ, 
pretzels, and bagels) should be considered in patients who complain of gasAvoidance of gluten to relieve digestive complaints has become popular in 
the treatment of IBS.One small controlled trial found that dietary restriction of fructose 
and/or fructans improved symptoms in patients with IBSAn increase in the intake of fiber is often recommended, either through 
diet or the use of commercial bulking supplements.
