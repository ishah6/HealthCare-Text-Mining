The pins and needle sensation could be indicative of carpal tunnel 
syndrome. This is caused by excessive work on the computer where the hand 
and the wrist is not in the normal anatomic position thus leading to 
compression of the median nerve at the level of the wrist and thus leading 
to tingling and numbness and weakness of the hands more on the thumb , 
index and middle finger area.Anti-inflammatory medications such as “Motrin”, “Aleve” and wrist splints 
may provide some relief. Severe cases may need local injection of 
corticosteroids. Specific stretching/strengthening program for the hand and 
wrist may be useful in improving strength and dexterity.
