I understand your concern about possible infertility. There could be 
several reasons for infertility. The problem could lie with either partner 
and may be a single identifiable factor of a combination of factors. 
Hormonal imbalance, anovulation, PCOS, pelvic inflammatory disease or 
decreased sperm count may all cause infertility. You may have to consult 
your doctor in this regard. Evaluation for infertility requires commitment 
and patience. The tests and periods of trial and error may extend over 
several months. I would suggest you first to consult your gynecologist and 
after an evaluation he might refer you to a specialist in infertility. A 
womb scrub may not be the best option in the management of infertility and 
may cause additional side-effects. I wish you the best.
