Your BF is an alcoholic and he is immature and selfish. He doesnt deserve the work that you are putting into him. If he would lay off the booze, maybe he could keep it up. His limpness is not your fault or responsibility. Thats like if you had some paper and wanted to write a story and someone gave you a pen that had no ink. You cant write if you dont have ink. Youve the goods and he just cant cash in. He would rather blame you for his shortcomings instead of address his real issues. Cut your losses and run like the wind. You wont have any peace with him and he will continuously chip away at your self-esteem. If you surround yourself with negative people, negative things are bound to occur. Try surrounding yourself with positive people and watch positive things start happening. He doesnt deserve you and he doesnt respect you. He is taking you for granted. He should be apologizing to you for not giving you the satisfaction that you desire. Three drunken days in a row.  BIG PROBLEM. Dont let him bring you down to his level.
