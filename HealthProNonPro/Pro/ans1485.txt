The symptoms of hair-fall, darkening of skin and weight gain may indicate 
an increase in the level of androgen in the system. This is usually seen in 
polycystic ovarian syndrome or a thyroid disorder. I would suggest that you 
see your gynecologist for further evaluation and tests. Your doctor may 
order blood-work which may include a complete blood count, glucose levels, 
DHEAS, thyroid levels, FSH and LH. Imaging studies like a pelvic 
ultrasound, CT and MRI may also be required.
