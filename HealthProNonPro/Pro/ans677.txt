It is common to experience night sweats from time to time. However, 
persistent night sweat sweats may reflect a more serious underlying 
pathology. Since you've been experiencing symptoms of cough, backache, 
fever and diarrhea, I would suggest that you see your doctor for a through 
evaluation. It is important to rule out and underlying disease such as 
infections (pneumonia, tuberculosis), lymphoma, leukemia, weakened immune 
system and hyperthyroidism.
