Tonsils are lymphoepithelial tissues that protect against inhaled 
pathogens. Tonsils do not play any part in voice production, therefore 
removing it will not cause you to lose your singing voice, however you may 
notice some pain and hoarseness after surgery due to the inflammation. I 
hope the information helps, take care.
