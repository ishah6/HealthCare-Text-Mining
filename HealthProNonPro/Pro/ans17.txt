A migraine headache can cause intense throbbing or pulsing in one area of 
the head and is commonly accompanied by nausea, vomiting, and extreme 
sensitivity to light and sound. Common triggers of migraine headaches 
include heat, stress, and lack of sleep or food. Migraines can be one-sided 
or involve both sides. These headaches may last from 23-72 hours. 
Medications can help reduce the frequency and severity of migraines. For 
mild attacks of migraine, Ibuprofen, Aspirin, and/or Naproxen may be 
helpful. If these won’t help, you may need prescription pain relievers for 
migraine (Tylenol #3, Ergot derivatives). I strongly recommend that you to 
get a thoroughly evaluation by an internal medicine doctor or neurologist 
to rule out any underlying pathology. For preventing migraine attacks, 
prescription drugs are also helpful: amitriptylline, calcium channel 
blockers, beta-blockers. I hope this helps, take care.
