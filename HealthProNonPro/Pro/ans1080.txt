Strep throat is a bacterial throat infection caused by Streptococcus 
pyogenes, or group A streptococcus. Strep throat is most common between the 
ages of 5 and 15, but it affects people of all ages. I do not think that 
the bumps on the back of your tongue is due to cancer. Strep throat may 
cause red and swollen tonsils and tiny red spots on the the area at the 
back of the roof of the mouth. These bumps will clear on their own with 
antibiotics and as the infection subsides.
