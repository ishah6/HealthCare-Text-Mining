Hiccups occur due to stimulation of the vagus nerve and the 
diaphragm. There are many, many causes of hiccups. This may result from a 
large meal, alcoholic beverages or sudden excitement. In some cases, 
hiccups may be a sign of an underlying medical condition. For most people, 
a bout of hiccups usually lasts only a few minutes. Rarely, hiccups may 
persist for months. Most cases of hiccups go away on their own, without 
medical treatment. If an underlying medical condition is causing your 
hiccups, treatment of that illness may eliminate the hiccups. Treatments 
with drugs such as Chlorpromazine, Metoclopramide (Reglan) and Baclofen 
(Lioresal) may be considered for hiccups that have lasted longer than two 
days.
