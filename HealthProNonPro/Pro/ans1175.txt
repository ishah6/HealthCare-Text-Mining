Thank you for your question. It is possible that this swelling could be a 
sebaceous cyst. Sebaceous cysts are pus filled structures that occur 
beneath the surface of the skin when a sebaceous gland gets clogged 
creating a nidus for bacterial growth and infection. The fact that this has 
increased in size means that you should have this examined by your doctor 
and possibly drained. This usually requires a small incision with a sterile 
blade to allow the excess pus to be squeezed out under local anesthetic. 
The cyst's capsule, a membranous structure lining the cyst cavity is also 
removed to prevent the recurrence of this cyst. After the wound will be 
dressed, and you will be placed on a course of antibiotics to prevent 
infection. It usually takes about 2 to 3 weeks to completely heal. Please 
see your doctor promptly to have this evaluated.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com with your medical question.
