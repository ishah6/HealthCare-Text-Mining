I do understand your concern. Not all breast discharges are caused due to 
breast cancer. Sometimes breast discharge can be seen with use of birth 
control pills, excessive breast stimulation, infection, abscesses and 
certain medications. It is always wise to take symptom of breast discharge 
seriously and consult your doctor. There can be many conditions which can 
lead to this some of which include cancer, intraductal papilloma etc. A 
physical examination by your doctor as well as a mammogram or an ultrasound 
would help confirm the diagnosis. I hope the information helps, I wish you 
well.
