According to your description, most likely you may have a Morton’s 
Neuroma, which is not a true neuroma, it produces pain in the distribution 
of the interdigital nerve secondary to repetitive irritation of the nerve. 
Possible cause of the irritation of the nerve: the previous puncture wound. 
The most common presenting complaints include pain, which is sharp and 
burning, and it may be associated with cramping. Morton's neuroma is known 
to develop as a result of chronic nerve stress and irritation, particularly 
with excessive toe dorsiflexion (toe upward) with activities such as 
prolonged walking, running, squatting. The conservative treatment (for 
both: 2nd MTT overload Syndrome and Morton’s Neuroma) involves footwear 
modifications: soft-soled shoes with a wide toe box and low heel. The next 
step is altering the alignment and elevation of the metatarsal heads which 
is achieved by wearing a plantar pad. This prevents more compression and 
irritation of the digital nerve and takes stress off the 2nd MTT and 
plantar fascia. Also a physical therapy program can be beneficial and may 
include: local cold packs (icing), ultrasound, deep tissue massage, and 
stretching exercises. The corticosteroids local injection is another 
treatment option that might be considered.
