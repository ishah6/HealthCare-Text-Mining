The presence of blood in urine may indicate a urinary tract infection. The 
presence of infection may be discovered by a urinalysis. An ultrasound, CT 
or MRI of the urinary tract may provide more detail. Chronic cases of 
hematuria will require a cystoscopy by a urologist.There is no specific treatment of hematuria other than treating the 
underlying disease.
