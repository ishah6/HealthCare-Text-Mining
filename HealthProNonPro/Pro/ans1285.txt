Thank you for your question. When you are on prescription medication, 
caution needs to be taken if you choose to take any vitamin, herbal, or 
dietary supplement. The reason being is that their ingredients have not 
been tested for their interaction with prescription medication. As a 
result, you can potentially have an adverse reaction, or your migraine 
medication may be rendered ineffective in treating your symptoms. We advise 
against using this dietary supplement while you are on topomax.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
