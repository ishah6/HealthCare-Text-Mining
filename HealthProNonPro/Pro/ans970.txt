Painful menstruation, also known as dysmenorrhea, is one of the most common 
gynecologic problems. The pain is caused by prostaglandins which cause 
muscle contractions in the uterus, decrease blood flow and oxygen to the 
uterus. There are two types of Dysmenorrhea. Primary Dysmenorrhea is where 
there is no underlying gynecological cause of pain and Seccondary 
Dysmenorrhea where some underlying gynecological condition is the cause of 
the pain. This primary management of dysmenorrhea are Non-steroidal antiinflammatory 
drugs (NSAIDs) and birth control pills. There are also certain 
non-pharmacological treatments that you can try :i) Applying heat to the lower abdomen with a heating pad, hot water bottle, 
or self-heating patch can significantly reduce pain.ii) Exercise seems to reduce menstrual symptoms, including pain, in some 
studies.iii) Healthy diet.iv) There is some evidence that complementary medicine practices such as 
yoga or acupuncture are effective in reducing painful periods.v) Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS) is a treatment that 
involves the use of electrode patches, which are applied to the skin near 
the area of pain. TENS has been used to treat pain caused by many 
conditions, and may help to reduce dysmenorrhea in some women.If the symptoms continue, further work-up may be necessary to diagnose any 
underlying cause of the pain, such as pelvic inflammatory disease, 
endometriosis or fibroids. Take care.
