Wolfram disease is a rare disease to diagnose. It is a rare association of 
diabetes insipidus, diabetes mellitus, optic atrophy, and deafness. This 
disorder is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait with incomplete 
penetrance.The characteristics of the disease are :i) Type 1 Diabetes, usually starting between ages 5 and 15.ii) Unusually frequent urination in large volumes, combined with constant 
thirst. Bedwetting starts again long after successful night training.iii) Visual impairment, starting with wearing glasses, but rapidly 
increasing, color blindnes and a slow reacting iris develops in early 
childhood.iv) High frequency hearing loss or tonal deafness Seizures may be present 
but may be due to electrolyte imbalance or diabetes. I would suggest that 
you speak to an endocrinologist for more information about the disease.
