It is most probable that you have a vaginal inclusion cyst. These cysts are 
caused as a result of trauma to the area or following a gynecological 
procedure. The cysts do not cause symptoms and presents as a soft lump that 
protrudes from the vagina. I would suggest that you see your doctor for 
further evaluation of the lump. In certain cases biopsy may be required to 
rule out cancer. Though most cases do not require treatment, surgical 
excision of cysts is usually done when it starts causing symptoms or for 
cosmetic reasons.
