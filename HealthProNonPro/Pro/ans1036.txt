Rich foods contain purines, which produce uric acid when they are 
metabolized by the body. When the body produces too much uric acid from 
food or is unable to eliminate normal amounts of uric acid because of 
kidney disease, the excess crystallizes and deposits in the small joints of 
the body, causing gout. When the big toe is affected with distinct pain, 
this is called podagra. The symptoms of gout are usually spontaneous and 
acute, and often occur at night. In the most common scenario, the big toe 
becomes painful, swollen and inflamed, but gout can also attack the joints 
of the feet, ankles, knees, hands and wrists. The range of normal Uric Acid 
level is different for males and females; males 2.1 to 8.5 mg/dL and 
females 2.0 to 7.0 mg/dL.
