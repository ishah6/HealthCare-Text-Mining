I do understand your concern. From the symptoms of your daughter, 
it definitely looks like a viral gastroenteritis infection. In some cases 
though, abdominal pain and loose stool that cannot be explained after a 
thorough physical examination and appropriate tests could indicate a 
functional abdominal pain. This is a frequent symptom in children for which 
the cause is not known. However, if the symptoms are worsening, other 
conditions such as constipation, lactose intolerance, infections, IBD, 
celiac disease, and food allergies may need to be investigated. Your child 
may benefit from certain dietary changes depending on her history. I 
would advise avoidance of greasy and spicy foods, caffeine, juices, and 
carbonated drinks. Eliminating lactose from the diet may benefit those who 
suffer from lactose intolerance in addition to functional abdominal pain. 
In addition, fruit drinks, sugar-free chewing gum, and sugar free candy 
sweetened with sorbitol should be avoided. I hope I have answered your 
question, I wish your daughter well.
