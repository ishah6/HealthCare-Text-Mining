May be you have two different problems, meaning ,a cervical nerve 
compression that is causing the shoulder pain radiated to the arm and on 
the other hand, a peripheral nerve compression at the level of the wrist 
called Carpal Tunnel Syndrome, producing the numbness in your hand. I 
suggest a visit to the neurologist who will order the adequate set of 
tests to determine if you have a cervical radiculopathy and also rule out 
a Carpal tunnel syndrome.
