I believe it totally depends on your relationship with that co-worker.  The most important thing is to be mindful of peoples feelings, and to remain professional.  If you do not have a relationship that allows you to comfortably and casually address the issue with your co-worker, its probably best to address this with HR and have general memo posted about hygiene.
