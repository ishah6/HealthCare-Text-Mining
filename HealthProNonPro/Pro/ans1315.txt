The burning feeling in the buttocks might be due to a sciatic nerve 
irritation, but you are also describing urinary symptoms that have not 
improved with the antibiotics prescribed, in that case I strongly recommend 
that your mother have a reevaluation by a specialist (Urologist) and lab 
tests, not only urine but cultures and possibly a sonogram to determine the 
cause of her symptoms and choose the adequate treatment.
