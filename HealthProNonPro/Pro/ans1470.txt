The sharp pain that you are experiencing in your left rib-cage could be due 
to soft tissue trauma, underlying chest infection, pancreatitis, gastritis 
or costochondritis. You may need to be evaluated by your doctor to 
determine whether the pain is muscular in origin or due to inflammation of 
other organs. I hope this helps. All the best.
