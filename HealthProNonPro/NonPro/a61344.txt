Ive tried yoga and meditation and it just doesnt work for me. 

I find it best to have relaxing warm shower, put on clean snug clothes and just have a lay down in a darkened room. 

Just chill out and try not to think about anything and youll soon be feeling refreshed.

However, if youre anything like me, get all your jobs done first, otherwise I lay there thinking about all the stuff I have to do!
