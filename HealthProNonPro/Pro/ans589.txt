I would suggest that you do not do the laundry if you are having an active 
disease. The herpes virus is considered contagious during this “active” 
time and can therefore be spread through direct contact with the infected 
area. Due to the fact that viral shedding can occur without any signs or 
symptoms, it is impossible to determine exactly when viral shedding is 
occurring.Antiviral medications have been proven to help reduce herpes viral 
shedding, helping to lower the risk of transmission.
