I watch this show called Body Challenge where a group of experts comes and basically remakes a family.  They said on there that 8-10 teaspoons of sugar per day is the max for a healthy diet and that even those teaspoons of sugar should be coming from fresh fruits or whole grain breads.  Natural foods not like candy and stuff.
