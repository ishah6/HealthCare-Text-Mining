Sometimes the nerve damage produced already before the surgery is severe 
and irreversible plus along with the degenerative changes in the 
vertebrae, these are possible causes of the chronic pain. The first 
approach is associate a Physical Therapy program aimed to control pain and 
inflammation along with anti-inflammatory medication, if there is no 
improvement and with time the pain is worse and intractable you should get 
a reevaluation by an orthopedic surgeon to decide if another intervention 
might be consider as a treatment option for you.
