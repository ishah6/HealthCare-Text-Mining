When the varicocele causes pain, testicular atrophy or infertility, it is 
recommended varicocele repair. The purpose of surgery is to seal off the 
affected vein to redirect the blood flow into normal veins. However, the 
effect of varicocele repair on fertility is unclear. Indications for 
repairing a varicocele in adolescence include progressive testicular 
atrophy, pain or abnormal semen analysis results. The surgery nowadays 
presents very few risks. Depends on what method was used to treat you, then 
the outcomes. Usually the repair methods include: Open surgery, 
Laparoscopic surgery, Percutaneous embolization; you do not say if it was 
open or laparoscopic surgery the method used in your case. It is not likely 
that the procedure is causing effects on the limbs growth. I suggest that 
you have a consultation with an orthopedic surgeon who will be able to tell 
you your bone age and the cause of the leg problem after order the 
corresponding imaging tests.
