Female surgical sterilization (also called tubal sterilization, tubal 
ligation, and tubal occlusion) is a low-risk, highly effective one-time 
procedure that offers lifelong protection against pregnancy. Laparoscopy is 
the most common surgical approach for tubal sterilization. Generally 
speaking, minilaparotomy is preferred for women who choose to be sterilized 
right after childbirth, while laparoscopy is preferred at other times. 
Minilaparotomy usually takes approximately 30 minutes to perform. Women who 
undergo minilaparotomy typically need a few days to recover and can resume 
intercourse after consulting their doctor. There is no ideal age or time 
period for sterilization. If you decide on not having kids in future, you 
may opt for this procedure any time.
