Increased sweating could be caused by a number of reasons. Alcohol and 
caffeine intake, thyroid problems, low blood sugar, infection and anxiety 
can all lead to increased sweating. The first step I would suggest is to 
make sure that you maintain proper hygiene, use antiperspirants and drink 
plenty of water to maintaining adequate hydration. If these measures do not 
help, you may need to see a doctor to rule out the causes I've mentioned. I 
hope this information helps, take care.
