i dont take over counter meds unless its to cure a pains/headache otherwise i bare it.  wash hands, drink lots of liquids-water, oj, sprite, stay warm, dont smoke or drink, lots of sleep, and keep the area around you clean and your clothes and sheets cleaned.  your body is just going through a battle and hope its only one of those couple day ones if longer then 4 days i see the doctor for the good meds that cure me up faster then anything!
