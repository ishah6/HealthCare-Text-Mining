Perhaps the people you are referring to are mentally ill.  I remember hearing a statistic about how a large percentage of the homeless population, for example, is mentally ill.  Im afraid that people who suffer from mental illness cant often "straighten up and try to be more like everybody else".  For example, you wouldnt tell a person with diabetes to snap out of it, so telling a person with mental illness to do that wouldnt make much sense either.

Of course, crazy is in the eye of the beholder.  Perhaps you just have expectations that are different from those of others.
