HCG (human chorionic gonadotropin) a hormone found in the urine of pregnant 
women. The way that the hormone is supposed to work is that it suppresses 
hunger and triggers the body to burn more fat. The oral HCG drops may 
actually contain very little amount of HCG and the weight loss is primarily 
due the restricted calorie intake that is advised along with HCG drops or 
injections. Although several studies have been conducted on HCG, none of 
these study find HCG helpful in weight-loss. Infact the restricted calorie 
intake may actually cause more harm to the body. So I would be cautious in 
using the drug.
