I do understand your concern. In my opinion the most probable cause for the 
irritation and discharge at the site of incision would be due to an 
incisional hernia or an abscess. I would suggest that you consult your 
doctor regarding these possibilities. Examination of the site with 
ultrasound or CT will give a clearer picture of your condition.
