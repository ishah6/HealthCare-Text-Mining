According to your description of the knee pain episodes, most likely you 
may be experiencing a Patellofemoral Syndrome. Knee pain is the most common 
presentation of patellofemoral syndrome. The pain typically is located 
behind/below /around the kneecap and often shows during activities that 
require knee flexion and forceful contraction of the quadriceps (ei, during 
squats, bicycle, ascending/descending stairs, jogging or pendants, 
prolonged kneeling). Pain may be worsen at night, by sitting with the knee 
flexed for a long period of time, such as while watching a movie, hence 
leading to the terms "theatre sign" and "movie-goer's knee." The causes are 
diverse: Overuse (repetitive use or activity), overloading, and misuse of 
the patellofemoral joint. The suggested strategy for conservative treatment 
should be as follows: Physical therapy program (exercises and pain control 
with TENS, ultrasound, ice packs after exercises), anti-inflammatory 
medication (i.e.: “Aleve”, “Advil”), wear a neoprene knee sleeve, 
education so you understand which activities avoid because those can 
aggravate patellofemoral syndrome. Also, and very important, remark the 
need for extended adherence to the exercise regimen. The physical therapist 
should educate you about a home exercise program.
