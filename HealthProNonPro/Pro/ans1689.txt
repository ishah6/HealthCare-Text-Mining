promptly. Though the bleeding could be caused by various problems, it is 
important to rule out cancer or precancer. The causes of bleeding in 
between periods could be due to change in hormone levels, uterine fibroids, 
cervicitis, polyps, hypothyroidism or implantation bleed in pregnancy. You 
should inform your doctor about any bleeding or spotting periods that you 
experience.
