Calcification of the kidneys or nephrocalcinosis is characterized by the 
generalized deposition of either calcium phosphate or calcium oxalate in 
the kidneys. Patients who develop nephrocalcinosis may have acute or 
chronic kidney injury, or may have normal renal function. Nephrocalcinosis 
is often incidentally detected by imaging studies.The underlying cause of nephrocalcinosis are primary hyperparathyroidism, 
sarcoidosis, vitamin D therapy, various kidney disease, inherited kideney 
disease like bartter's syndrome and dent's disease and chronic hypokalemic 
states. The prognosis of nephrocalcinosis depends on the underlying cause. 
The underlying cause of nephrocalcinosis should be determined and treated 
if possible since the renal prognosis is determined by the underlying 
disease. No specific treatment has been shown to prevent progression of 
nephrocalcinosis. I would also suggest that you increase fluid intake, and 
reduce intake of animal protein.
