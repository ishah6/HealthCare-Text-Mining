Thank you for your question. We believe that the symptoms you are 
experiencing are due to the specific disease that they are related to. For 
example, the joint pain you are experiencing is likely due to complications 
associated with gout. Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome can have symptoms of 
lower abdominal pain and cramping, and Tietze's syndrome can mimic the pain 
associated with myocardial infarction (as you indicated). There is no 
syndrome that we know off that contains all three of that contain all of 
these disease states however we do recommend that you are closely monitored 
by your doctor to make sure that these diseases are getting worse.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
