Corticosteroid injections are given to reduce the inflammation and swelling 
of a joint. Since you are experiencing sever back pain after the 
injections, I would suggest you to consult your doctor/orthopedician 
regarding this matter. A physical examination and x-ray/CT of the back may 
prove helpful in diagnosing the problem.
