I have used them all and Cialis is definitely the best.  Much longer acting, 17 hour half life versus 4 for Viagra, with far fewer side effects such as facial flushing and stuffy nose.  A much cleaner drug than Viagra.  Levits is similar to Viagra in terms of half life but also has somewhat less side effects in most.
