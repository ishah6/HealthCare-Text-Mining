Pravastatin is a drug that is used for lowering the cholesterol levels and 
will not treat your acid reflux symptoms. I would suggest that you consult 
your doctor for treatment options available for reflex such as H2 blockers 
and proton pump inhibitors. Long standing cases of reflux may also require 
an upper endoscopy to see for the presence of gastric ulcers.
