Yes, usually in your age group the cervical radiculopathy (cervical nerve 
compression) is often a result of spinal canal narrowing from bone 
(osteophyte, bone spur) formation, decreased disc height and degenerative 
changes due to aging process. The treatment strategy usually includes: 
physical therapy program aimed to reduce pain and inflammation, and the use 
of anti-inflammatory medication (“Motrin”, “Aleve”), also a re-education of 
your habits and posture to improve quality of life. You should be 
independent in a stretching and strengthening program and continue with 
these exercises under the periodic supervision of a physical therapist 
initially and then completely on your own. Patients whose condition fails 
to improve with a comprehensive rehabilitation program and selective 
injections should be presented with a surgical evaluation. Often, patients 
should show progressive improvement over the first 6-8 weeks with 
conservative treatment. If there is no significant improvement in this time 
frame, consider a surgical evaluation.
