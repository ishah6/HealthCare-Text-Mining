well how old is he? just to be safe i would take him to the er as soon as possible.
a 106 temp is incredibaly dangerous, and even if it doesnt show, it could still be running that high.
plus all the way down to 95.5 is a big drop, and if he is young, he might go into shock, so u really should take him in.
good luck!
