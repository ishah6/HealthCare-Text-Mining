Thank you for your question. We recommend that you follow your doctor's 
instructions to avoid excessive weight bearing activity on the affected 
foot for the duration of the six weeks. After this period of time, you will 
be reevaluated by your physician to determine the level activity you will 
be able to tolerate after this procedure. Core decompression is commonly 
used to relieve pressure that builds up within a bone due to an 
inflammatory condition such as osteonecrosis of the bone. This will 
facilitate the formation of new blood vessels and marrow production in this 
area of diseased bone, restoring its strength. This may require months to 
heal and weeks of physiotherapy and careful monitoring to prevent 
microfractures. If you follow your doctors precautions, you are likely to 
make a full recovery and you can return to running after you are cleared by 
your doctor.AskTheDoctor.com wishes you a speedy recovery.
