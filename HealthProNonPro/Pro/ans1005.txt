Pregnancy tests are fairly accurate in detecting pregnancy if done 
properly. The best time to take them is after a week or more of a missed 
period. They measure the level of beta hcg in the urine to give you a 
positive or negative response. The test is best done early morning. I would 
advice you to retake the pregnancy test to see whether it has changed as 
the days have passed. All the best.
