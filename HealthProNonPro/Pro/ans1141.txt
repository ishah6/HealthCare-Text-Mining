Thank you for your question. Given the fact that there is very little data 
pertaining to the interaction of bromelain with prescription medications we 
would advise not taking this natural medicine. There can be adverse 
reactions that we are unaware of which can range from decreasing the 
efficacy or absorption of these medications to a life threatening adverse 
reaction. For this reason, we do not advise taking it.Thank you for consulting AskTheDoctor.com
