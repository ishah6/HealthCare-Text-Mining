The only way to determine pregnancy is for you to do a urine pregnancy 
test. The spotting may be caused either due to an implantation bleed or due 
to hormonal imbalance or an anovulatory cycle. I would advise you to do a 
urine pregnancy test and consult you family doctor for further 
investigations and follow up.
