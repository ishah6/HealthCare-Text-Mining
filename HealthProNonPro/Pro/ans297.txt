Fever during the nights could indicate an underlying infection such as 
urine infection, cold, cough, sore throat, viral or bacterial infection. 
The blood in the urine could be due to a urinary tract infection, kidney 
stones, benign prostate hyperplasia and in rare cases tumors of the bladder 
and prostate. I would advise that your husband see a urologist for further 
evaluation and necessary investigations like ultrasound of the kidney, 
ureters and bladder, urine culture and microscopy, a complete blood count 
and a chest x-ray.
