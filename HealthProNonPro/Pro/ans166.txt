Breast pain or mastalgia may be caused by hormonal changes, trauma, breast 
cysts, imbalance of fatty acids within the cells and certain medications 
like antidepressants. Women with large breasts may have noncyclic breast 
pain related primarily to the size of their breasts. This type of breast 
discomfort is typically accompanied by neck, shoulder and back pain. You 
may need to see your doctor for further evaluation. Treatment involves 
treating the underlying cause, anti-inflammatory medication and oral 
contraceptives.
