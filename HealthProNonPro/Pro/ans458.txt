I do understand your concern of an underlying knee injury. The stability of 
the knee joint is maintained by the medial and lateral collateral ligaments 
on the side of the knee and the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments 
on the inside. There is also the menisci that act as a cushion in the knee 
joint.It is difficult for me to comment on the underlying injury without 
evaluating you. In my opinion the symptoms of instability of the joint 
you've mentioned warrants for further investigation and examination by an 
orthopedic surgeon. The feeling of "giving way" or instability of the joint 
suggests a meniscal tear/injury. If your symptoms are not relieved with 
analgesics, rest, ice, compression bandage and elevation, I would suggest 
you consult your doctor. It is not advisable to stress the joint by doing 
any sports activity or workout.
