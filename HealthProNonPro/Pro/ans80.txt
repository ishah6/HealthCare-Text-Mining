After almost three years from the last epidural, maybe some other causes 
of your symptoms may be rule out. I advise you to get an evaluation by an 
orthopedic surgeon or spine specialist to exclude a possible local lipoma 
on the site of the injection, or even a nerve compression. Some of the 
major causes of acute and chronic back pain are associated with 
radiculopathy (nerve compression). Lumbosacral radiculopathy, like other 
forms of radiculopathy, results from nerve root impingement and/or 
inflammation that has progressed enough to cause neurologic symptoms in the 
areas that are supplied by the affected nerve root, the legs for example. 
During the acute phase of the pain, the physical therapy is very important 
and involves the use of ultrasound, TENS, heat to control pain, teaching 
you back-protection techniques (e.g., proper lifting, posture awareness). A 
lumbar stabilization program is also useful in instructing you in various 
techniques to control back pain, and you also can work on strengthening the 
stabilizing muscles of the lumbar spine.
