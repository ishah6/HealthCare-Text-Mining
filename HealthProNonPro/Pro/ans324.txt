Gaining weight requires no rocket science. The basis of weight gain is to 
eat more calories than you expend each day. It is important to take a well 
balanced diet containing carbohydrates, proteins and fats. Carbohydrates 
are the basic fuel source and is required by the body for growth and 
recovery. Food rich in carbohydrates are rice, cereals, bread and corn. 
Proteins are the building block of muscle in the body and are needed for 
gaining muscle. Wheat, egg and soy are good sources of protein. Dietary fat 
help the body to absorb nutrients, encouraging growth and healthy skin and 
hair. Milk and milk products are good sources of fats. If these measures do 
not help then you may require further investigation to rule out any 
underlying conditions that may be causing you to lose weight.
