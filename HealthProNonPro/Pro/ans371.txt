Hidradenitis suppurativa is a chronic skin inflammation characterized by 
swollen, painful, inflamed lesions in the axilla, groin, and other parts of 
the body. The exact cause of hidradenitis suppurativa is unclear, but 
hormonal effects, obesity, stress, smoking, genetics are some of the 
factors known to be associated with this condition. Though there is no cure 
for hidradenitis, treatment will decrease the emergence of new lesions. 
Mild cases can be treated with self-care measures, including warm 
compresses and regular washings with antibacterial soap. Moderate cases may 
require topical or oral medications.
