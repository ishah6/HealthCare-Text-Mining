Palpitations are the sensation that your heartbeat is not normal. Although 
the sensations may vary, all of them cause you to have an uncomfortable 
awareness of your heartbeat. There are many causes of palpitations, which 
range from mild to serious. Palpitations can result from cardiovascular, 
gastrointestinal, psychological, or respiratory diseases, disorders, and 
conditions. Since you've mentioned that you are taking losartan HCT, I 
would suggest that you see your family doctor to check whether your blood 
pressure is under control with the current medication. High blood pressure 
is one of the causes of heart palpitations symptoms.
