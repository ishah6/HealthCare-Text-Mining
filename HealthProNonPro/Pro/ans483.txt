I do understand your concern, your symptoms could have been caused by a 
urinary tract infection or kidney stones. It is unlikely that an acute 
infection will cause kidney damage. I would suggest that you see a doctor 
for urinalysis, kidney function tests, urine culture, ultrasound of the 
kidneys, ureters and bladder and cystoscopy if required. Antibiotics is 
definitely indicated in the presence of infection.
