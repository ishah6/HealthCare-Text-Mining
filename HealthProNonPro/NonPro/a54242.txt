Ive gone about 5 days without eating much and except for a very little weight loss, I didnt have any physical symptoms.  

You HAVE to have liquid.  Without it, your organ will start to shutdown in matter of few days.  

Instead of trying to find out how long you can go in the condition you are in now, and look for the worse possible condition you cant go beyond, how about trying to solve the problem that made you depressed in the first place?

I have to warn you, if you go too far, you start to lose an ability to clearly think - which is a danger on its own because then you lost an ability to know you need to do something.

If you are by yourself, the danger is even higher.

Please get out of the house, talk to your freinds or family.  One or two days of no food wont harm you, but beyond that, you really should get SOMETHING to eat.  Crackers or fruit maybe.
