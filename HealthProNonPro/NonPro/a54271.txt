Uh, sorry but no, not safely anyway. The safest weight you want to lose in a week is 1.5 to 2 lbs.  Of course when you reduce your calories, you may find you will lose more weight quickly in the first two weeks, but then your body will adjust and you will lose the 1.5 to 2lbs. 

To do this pick what you want to weight...say...150 lbs.( an example)  add another zero that number and you get 1500...that is how may calories you can eat in a day to lose weight and maintain that weight. (150)  It wont happen overnight and you will need to exercise!  One great exericse...walking!!! 

I added a site for more information!
