According to your description, many patients with MS may present not only 
with multiple joint pain but also with Dysesthesia, which is an altered 
sense of touch perceived as an unpleasant or painful, burning, itching or 
prickling sensation. Dysesthesia is a common sensory symptom in patients 
with Multiple Sclerosis as you, up to 90% of people with MS report some 
form of altered sense of touch. These are caused by the MS lesions on the 
brain or spinal cord, and can occur in feet, legs, hands, arms producing 
pain and problems with the movements; even in the genitalia where they 
cause sexual dysfunction, incontinence or in the tongue causing problems 
speaking (dysarthria). If this dysesthesia occurs as part of a relapse 
episode it may or may not resolve completely, sometimes remains as residual 
symptom sticking around. Generally with the corticosteroids treatment the 
duration and severity of the relapse is reduced and this may relieve the 
dysesthesia too.
