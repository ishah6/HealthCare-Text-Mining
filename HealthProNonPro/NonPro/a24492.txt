I have had Fibro since I was 16 and am now almost 36. I have seen more doctors over the years than I can count from Neurologists to Rhuematologists to Chiropractors to Psychiatrists to Pain Specialists. In my experience pain medications do not work. A muscle relaxant is much more helpful. I have also tried biofeedback, steroid shots, trigger point injections, two sleep studies, nerve blocks, accupuncture, foot braces, wrist braces, carpal tunnel release surguries, and so much more. All just torture and I felt like a guinea pig.
My best advise is make sure to get plenty of sleep, take a multiple vitamin, keep active in at least low impact sports, and consider Magnesium and Malic Acid supplements (consult the doctor or a nutritionist to have your Magnesuim level checked- it is a simpe mouth swab and not painful), meditation does help some in keeping the pain back if you can seperate your mind from the pain, and try to take 2-3 warm Epson Salt baths a week (Epson salt contains Magnesium and soaking in a warm tub of it helps to get the mineral into the body. Magnesium aids the muscles in using oxygen and when the level is low which is typical in Fibro it can cause are cramps, spasms, and pain.) 
Also, Fibromyalgia is a neurotransmitter disorder and certain foods can trigger similiar symptoms to Fibro. Try eliminating Monsodium Glutamate from your diet. I did and some of my symptoms (chronic headaches and nausea) went away. It is in everything from Doritos to chicken soup. A few key findings of an FDA study found MSG to cause a "burning sensation in the back of the neck, forearms and chest". Otherwise, learn your limits and pace yourself.
Good luck!
