Infectious mononucleosis (mono) is transmitted through saliva, so you can 
get it through kissing, but you can also be exposed through a cough or 
sneeze, or by sharing a glass or food utensil with someone who has mono. 
However, mononucleosis isn't as contagious as some infections, such as the 
common cold.
