I do understand your concern. From symptoms alone, this looks more like a 
genital herpes infection. Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted 
infection (STI) caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). There are two 
types of HSV. HSV 1 usually affects the mouth and lips and HSV 2 involves 
the genitals. Infection with HSV is likely if your skin comes into contact 
with someone who already has herpes. The transmission of the virus is 
higher when there is presence of sores, blisters or rash. Blood tests can 
be done to check for antibody levels to the herpes virus. Genital herpes 
cannot be cured. However, antiviral medication can relieve pain and 
discomfort during an outbreak by healing the sores more quickly. Antiviral 
medicines used to treat herpes include acyclovir, famciclovir, and 
valacyclovir. In the meantime wear loose-fitting cotton garments, cleanse 
the area gently with soap and water and keep the area dry.
