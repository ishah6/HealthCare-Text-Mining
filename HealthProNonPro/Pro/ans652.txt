Infection of both the tooth and ear could cause similar symptoms that you 
are currently experiencing. You may try taking Amoxicillin along with an 
anti-inflammatory like advil/motrin. If your symptoms are not better within 
72 hours, I would then suggest you visit your doctor for further evaluation.
