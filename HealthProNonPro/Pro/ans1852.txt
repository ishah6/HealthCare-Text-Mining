Your symptoms of chest and left arm pain typically points towards angina or 
a heart attack. Though pain arising from the heart, lungs, upper 
gastrointestinal system and chest wall may all present with similar 
symptoms. I would still advice you to see you GP for a more thorough 
physical examination including a BP and a cardiac exam , other testing like 
a lipid panel along with a cardiac stress test and an ECG to rule out any 
intrinsic cardiac problem like an angina.
