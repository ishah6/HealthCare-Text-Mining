First of all, why do you take Vicodin every day? I know a lot of people that have become addicted while taking it and it was prescribed by their medical doctor. I dont know why doctors continue to prescribe it. 
If I were you I would talk to your doctor regarding your concerns. I would ask him(her) if another drug could be given instead. Especially if it is going to be a long term drug.
