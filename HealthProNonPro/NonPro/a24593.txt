It is possible, but unlikely.  Know a lady that got crabs from a dirty motel bed, pretty sure she was not sexually active 75 year old nun, could be wrong ... those giant penguins can get freaky deaky (I know I am gonna burn in hell for that but I dont care because its funny).  The only way to be sure is to go to a clinic and get tested.
