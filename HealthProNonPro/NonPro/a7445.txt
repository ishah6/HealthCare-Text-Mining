Im not finding any information on pigeon feces causing cancer. It is not unknown for viruses to cause cancer in some animals, but HPV that is correlated with cervical cancer is the only virally associated cancer in humans. I did find something that might have a connection though. From the website listed below:

"Cryptococcal CNS infections usually involve both the brain and meninges, causing diffuse disease. Immunocompetent hosts may present with either meningitis or focal cryptococcomas. Meningitis manifests with diffuse, nonfocal findings (eg, altered mental status, vomiting), whereas cryptococcomas often manifest with focal neurologic defects."

The spores that cause cryptococcal infection can be found in bird feces, and people who have cancer (or are otherwise immunocompromised) are more susceptible to the infection. CNS is central nervous system. The meninges are the linings of the brain and spinal cord. 

Cancer is not caused by a B17 deficiency.
