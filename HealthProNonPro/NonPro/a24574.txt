You need to be 18 but some abortion clinics will allow you to go to get court permission and your parents dont need to know. Call your local abortion clinic and ask them. They might have better advice to give you then you could find in here. Also, dont let anyone in here judge you. We have all done things that other people may not agree with. That doesnt make it right or wrong. You are not a horrible person but just make sure you discuss every option (and there are alot out there) with your doctor and the babys father but dont let anyone force your decision. Good luck.
