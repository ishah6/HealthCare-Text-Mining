The pictures that you have sent suggest that you may be suffering from a 
nasolacrimal duct obstruction. This is usually caused due to an infection 
of the lacrimal ducts, thickening of the tear duct lining, sinusitis, 
abnormal bone spurs compressing the tear ducts and tumors in rare cases. 
You may need to visit your opthalmologist for a complete examination. 
Microscopical and culture studies of the lacrimal discharge, imaging 
studies like dacryoscintigraphy, CT and MRI may be helpful in the 
diagnosis. The treatment will depend on the cause of the obstruction. 
Antibiotics are indicated in the presence of infection and surgery 
(endoscopic dacryocystorhinostomy) in case of antomical obstruction.
