Any abdominal pain that causes severe pain warrants further evaluation and 
tests. It is difficult for me to say what is the cause of your abdominal 
pain. It could be caused by non-abdominal causes such as pneumonia, 
myocardial infarction or abdominal problems. Your symptoms are not those of 
acid reflux. Since your scan rules out abnormalities of gallbladder and 
pancreas, the next step in the management would be a colonoscopy or a 
sigmoidoscopy to rule out an inflammatory disease of the intestines or in 
rare cases tumors.
