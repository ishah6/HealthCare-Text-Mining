It is unlikely that the movements you feel in your tummy is due to 
pregnancy. Fetal movements are usually felt in between 16 to 20 weeks and 
since your pregnancy test was negative the month earlier, pregnancy can be 
ruled out. Sometime these movements could be the result of something known 
as pseudocyesis or false pregnancy. Although the exact causes still aren't 
known, doctors suspect that psychological factors may trick the body into 
"thinking" that it's pregnant. I would advise an ultrasound to rule out 
pregnancy and any underlying pelvic pathology. I hope this helps, take care.
