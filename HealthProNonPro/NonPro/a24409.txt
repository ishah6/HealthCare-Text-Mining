dont listen to w/e shiz these guys r tellin u what you just need 2 do is just complete your things, what that means is everything u start u finish. it realy is that simple. when u take somthing out of the fridge, u put it back. u go to do somthing u just finish it. it really is that simple dont lock ur self in a closet and shove a thumb up ur but then chant an ancient folk song or w/e these guys r telling u just try my thing for a week, no a day, no just try it! it rely works its so stupid but it works!
