It is difficult from just the light periods to know whether you are 
ovulating or not. Menstruation is a very complicated process and it is 
difficult to be 100% accurate. Ovulation usually takes place roughly 14 
days after the first day of the start of a period; however, the exact 
timing can vary greatly from woman to woman. Certain signs of ovulation are 
lower pain abdomen, change in cervical mucus and rise in body temperature. 
You can try using ovulation predictor kits to detect the surge in 
luteinizing hormone (LH) in your urine just before ovulation. They're 
easier to use and often more accurate than the BBT method, and they can 
predict ovulation 12 to 36 hours in advance and help you maximize your 
chance of conception the very first month you use them.
