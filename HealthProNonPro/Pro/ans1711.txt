Warts are caused by human papillomavirus (HPV) and is extremely common in 
young adults. Common warts can be contagious and can spread through cuts in 
the skin or walking barefoot in public areas. Many common warts don't 
require treatment. They usually disappear within two years, though new ones 
may develop nearby. You may want to treat them for cosmetic purposes, if 
they're causing discomfort or to prevent their spread.
