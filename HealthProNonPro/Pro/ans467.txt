I do understand your concern that you may be suffering from peptic ulcer. 
Pain in the abdomen may arise from the stomach, duodenum, liver, the lower 
part of the esophagus and the pancreas.It is difficult to accurately diagnose pain abdomen without further 
examination and test. In my opinion you will have to see your 
doctor/gastroenterologist to rule out GERD, peptic ulcer, gastritis and 
pancreatitis as the cause of pain abdomen. It is also important to do an 
electrocardiogram to diagnose for Angina and myocardial infarction which 
may present with similar symptoms.
