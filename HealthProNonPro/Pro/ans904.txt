Most likely your body got “deconditioned” due to the inactivity period of 
not going to the gym and doing no workouts for a while. As a result of the 
effort lifting a heavy object you had an injured tendon. I suggest that you 
start an exercise routine in which you should increase progressively the 
physical demands in order to avoid further Overuse or Stress injuries. The 
overuse creates stress that the body cannot repair, and soft tissue 
breakdown occurs.
