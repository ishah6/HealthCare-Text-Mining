There are many causes of sciatic nerve inflammation: blunt injury, 
compression by the surrounding muscles, intervertebral disk degeneration or 
lumbar disk disease, all of them can produce pain along the sciatic nerve. 
The conventional treatment for Sciatica is aimed to relieve the pain and 
besides the use of anti-inflammatory medication (as “Motrin”, “Aleve”) and 
vitamin B complex, a physical therapy program can benefit you, with 
stretching of the hip muscles and local heat or ultrasound application. It 
is very important also avoid activities that place stress on the lumbar 
spine. Sometimes the pain and discomfort can persist for several weeks 
before to improve. The local corticosteroid injection may be considered for 
patients who show limited response to oral medication and physical therapy.
