The cause of urinary incontinence in kids may be due to an overactive 
bladder caused by urinary tract infection, anxiety problems, small bladder 
capacity and structural problems of the urinary system. An increased levels 
in the protein content of the urine may suggest of an underlying urinary 
tract infection. In the end it is very difficult to point out the cause of 
urinary incontinence without investigations. Your urologist may do a 
urinalysis, urine culture, ultrasound of pelvis, CT, IVP and cystoscopy to 
help determine the cause.
