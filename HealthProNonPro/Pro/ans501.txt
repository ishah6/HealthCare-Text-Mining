I do understand your concern. It is difficult for me to say whether you are 
developing psoriatic arthritis or not. There is no specific diagnostic 
tests available for psoriatic arthritis. Diagnosis of the disease is made 
based on clinical and radiologic criteria in a patient with psoriasis. The 
symptoms of psoraitic arthritis are joint pain, stiffness, swelling and may 
effect any joint from the fingers and toes to the spine. Unfortunately, 
there is no cure for psoriatic arthritis. The treatment options include 
anti inflammatory drugs, DMARDS and immunosuppressant medication 
(methotrexate). You can help yourself by keeping a healthy weight, 
exercising regularly, avoiding additional stress, applying alternating hot 
and cold packs several times a day and getting enough rest during the day.
