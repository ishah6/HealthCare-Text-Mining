OK dovie, excersise does help, but eating right has alot to do with it.I was overweight and lived too far away from a fitness club(and I had a suspicion they were a waste of money),so I cut down on red meat and bread,and hiked the trails on the mountain ridges near my home(in MA.)nd walked everywere I could,and I lost @ 100 lbs in a year! It wont happen overnight,and those pills you see on TV are ripoffs,you dont need to pay to lose weight, you gotta have self discipline,and be commited to it.It takes some serios determination,but once you start seeing results,keep on going.
