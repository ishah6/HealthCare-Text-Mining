This is most probably due to a folliculitis. Folliculitis is the 
inflammation of the hair folliciles due to tight clothing, shaving or when 
the pores get blocked. There may also be an underlying infection associated 
with the folliculitis. Most of the time warm compresses and oral or topical 
antibiotics (mupirocin) help to resolve the folliculitis. I would advice 
you not to put any other material on the boil (other than mupirocin) as it 
may only worsen the condition. Sometimes an abscess may develop and the 
only treatment then is to surgically drain the abscess.
