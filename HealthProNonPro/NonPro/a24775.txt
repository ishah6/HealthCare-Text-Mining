I do not suggest you use any Home Remedies for whitening teeth because the results will never be close to what you get with professional products.  

The best ways to whiten teeth is to 1)Ask your dentist about Zoom! 2)In office bleaching 3) Take home trays like Crest whitening strips.  

If you cant afford these things then your best best is to buy a whitening toothpaste such as Crest Whitening toothpaste.  Check the link below for more details.
