I do understand your concern for the symptoms that you are facing. It is 
most probable that you are breathing with you mouth during sleep. This 
results in drying of the mucous membranes of the mouth and increase the 
saliva thickness.I would advise you to see your doctor or sleep therapist and make sure that 
the size of the CPAP mask is appropriate for you. Also you may use 
humidifiers at a low setting to relieve the symptoms. Use of chin straps 
will help keep the mouth closed during sleep. Oral creams can also be used 
to prevent excessive drying of the mucosa.
