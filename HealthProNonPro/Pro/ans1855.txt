Your symptoms of dysphagia (difficulty in swallowing food) could be the 
result of a decreased compliance of the esophagus obstructing the entry of 
food into the stomach. You may be at a risk for dysphagia if you are a 
smoker, consume alcohol and have a reflux disease. The other causes could 
be due to a formation of stricture in the esophagus, neuromuscular weakness 
or tumors of the esophagus. I would suggest you to see a gastroenterologist 
for further investigation. Endoscopy may be helpful to determine the site 
and cause of the block.
