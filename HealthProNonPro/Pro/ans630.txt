In my opinion you may be suffering from dyspepsia. This is a common symptom 
with an extensive differential diagnosis. It occurs in approximately 25 
percent of the population. Dyspepsia can be caused by a number of disorders 
such as peptic ulcer disease, gastroesophageal reflux and biliary 
dysfunction.I would recommend that you consult a gastroenterologist for a history and 
physical examination supplemented with appropriate laboratory, 
radiographic, and endoscopic investigation.
