The heartburn and trowing up of clear fluid is a sign or acid reflux 
disease (GERD). The backwash of acid irritates the lining of your esophagus 
and causes GERD signs and symptoms. Treatment for heartburn and other signs 
and symptoms of GERD usually begins with over-the-counter medications that 
control acid. Prilosec is used to treat symptoms of gastroesophageal reflux 
disease (GERD) and other conditions caused by excess stomach acid. I would 
advise you to continue taking prilosec. Also you will need to wait at least 
two to three hours after eating before lying down or going to bed, elevate 
the head of your bed, avoid smoking, avoid common triggers such as fatty or 
fried foods, alcohol, chocolate, mint, garlic, onion and caffeine may make 
heartburn worse. If your acid reflux persists after following these 
recommendations, consult your primary care physician for a more detailed 
evaluation and prescription of more potent antacids.
