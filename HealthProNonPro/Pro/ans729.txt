It is difficult to say whether the loss of sensation in your penis is a 
result of the hernia surgery. Usually there is a small risk of injuring the 
nerves that supply the genital regain in an inguinal hernia repair. Since 
you have not mentioned what surgery you've had, it is difficult for me to 
comment on your symptoms. I would suggest that you consult your surgeon 
regarding your problem. I wish you well, take care.
