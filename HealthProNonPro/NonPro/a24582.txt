First of all, way to go! You are definitely on the right track to a bright future by setting goals and focusing yourself at this point in your life. 

If you are interested in nursing I would assume that track would require lots of math, biology, chemistry, etc. A college advisor can better help you when the time comes to pick the particular classes. 

There are also other routes you could take to work with diabetic patients and do research on the topic. I am a Diabetes Health Educator with my local health district. My BS degree is in English and my MA will also be in English when I finish in Dec. 2006. I have a background in education also. So, it doesnt necessarily take a background in the health field to work with the condition. 

Good luck and best wishes working on your goals!
