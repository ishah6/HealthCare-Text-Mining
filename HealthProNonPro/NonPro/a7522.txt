well before i started my period i wanted to start so bad cuz i thought it would make me more of a women...well now i just want it to go away...if u have cramps (witch most people do!)it hurts like hell! and then it gets really annoying when is starts unexpected and u get blood all over the place...ur always in a constint worry if you will leak and go through your clothes!!! its horrible...but once you start you kinda get used to it!just dont rush it!
