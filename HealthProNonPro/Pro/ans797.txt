It make take several months after stopping birth control pills for your 
periods to become regular. I would suggest you to wait and watch for 
symptoms and if this continues I would suggest you to consult with your 
gynecologist to see for any underlying complications. Also since you've 
stopped the birth control pill, there may be a chance that you are 
pregnant. You may need to take a urinary pregnancy test to confirm 
pregnancy. I hope that answers your question.
