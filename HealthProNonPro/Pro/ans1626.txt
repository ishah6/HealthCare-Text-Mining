Though the most common cause of bleeding from rectum is due to hemorrhoids, 
your husband may need to see his doctor/gastroenterologist to rule out 
other serious conditions causing the bleeding. A digital rectal examination 
and an anoscopy or colonoscopy will help determine the site of the bleed. 
In the meantime, a sitz bath, anesthetic creams, stool softeners will help 
relieve the symptoms. I hope this information helps.
