Thank you for your question. When treating hypertension, medication may 
often need to be adjusted to optimally control your blood pressure. Based 
on the description you provided, your blood pressure was too low when being 
treated with Atenolol and Hydrochlorothiazide (Modrex). Switching your 
atenolol (beta blocker) to enalapril (ACE inhibitor) may provide a more 
regulated reduction in your blood pressure without the drastic decrease you 
experienced while being on this previous medication. Enalapril is a 
different class of antihypertensive medication which acts at the level of 
the kidney by inhibiting an enzyme that is responsible for the activation 
of a substance that raises blood pressure.
