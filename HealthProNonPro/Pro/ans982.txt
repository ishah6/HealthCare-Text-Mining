Phimosis is defined as a tight foreskin that cannot be retracted to expose 
the glans penis. In young children, phimosis is normal or physiologic. I 
would advise that you see a doctor for further evaluation. Do not try to 
forcibly retract your foreskin, which may only lead to more scarring. 
Treatment will depend on the cause of phimosis. The non surgical treatment 
of phimosis includes topical steroid creams and manual stretching of the 
foreskin. Surgical methods consists of circumcision, slitting of the 
foreskin and preputioplasty. You may have to consult with your doctor for 
proper diagnosis and treatment, take care.
