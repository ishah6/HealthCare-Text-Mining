It may be difficult to point out the cause of your abdominal pain on 
history alone. Your symptoms of stomach pain could be caused by 
constipation, colitis or acute appendicitis. Co-codamol is definitely known 
to cause constipation and would most probable be the cause of your 
constipation. If your symptoms worsen or your abdomen gets distended, you 
may need to see your doctor immediately.
