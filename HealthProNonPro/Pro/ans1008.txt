Presence of a breast lump needs to be examined and evaluated by your doctor 
to rule out breast cancer. The causes of painful breast lump are : 
infections or abscesses, breast injury, benign breast lumps or 
fibroadenomas and breast cysts. Your doctor may order an ultrasound of the 
breast to see for an underlying cyst or abscess and may even order a needle 
aspiration for microscopical study.
