The most probably cause of your burning sensation while passing urine may 
be due to cystitis caused due to a urinary tract infection. This is usually 
caused by an ascending bacterial infection from the urethra. The first line 
of treatment is antibiotics. A urinalysis may help to detect the presence 
of infection. Drinking plenty of water will help to flush out the bacteria 
in the urine.
