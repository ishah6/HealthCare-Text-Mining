Though there may be a chance that you are pregnant, they are minimal. To 
confirm pregnancy, the best period to do a urine pregnancy test is 2 weeks 
after the unprotected test. The test should be done in the morning. If your 
symptoms worsen, I would advise you to see your doctor and to see whether 
the pain is due to dysmenorrhea/menstrual cramps or premenstrual syndrome.
