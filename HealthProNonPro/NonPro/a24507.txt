There is no such thing as localized fat loss.  You can do all the exercises you want but you have no control over where the fat comes off first.  Your options, then, are twofold:
1) plastic surgery
2) lose weight all over and eventually that trouble spot will come off

I guess a third option is "just live with it" but I know thats facile and unhelpful!
