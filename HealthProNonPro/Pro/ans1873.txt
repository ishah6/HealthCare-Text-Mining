Zopiclone is a nonbenzodiazepine hypnotic used in the treatment 
of transient and short-term insomnia. Zopiclone is administered orally 
just before bedtime and cannot be used as a suppository. Gastrointestinal 
problems like dry mouth, dyspepsia, halitosis and bitter taste in mouth 
are common side-effects of the drug. I would advise that you speak to your 
doctor on other alternative if you cannot tolerated the bitter taste 
side-effect of zopiclone.Nonbenzodiazepine
