Provided dieters can stick to the plan, afford the foods and eat everything 
that is provided, they should be able to lose weight. Medifast seeks to 
balance its foods nutritionally, with protein, carbs and other nutrients, 
to ensure that adequate nutrition is received, and warns that not eating 
all of the foods can actually stall weight-loss, as the body begins to seek 
certain nutrients and hangs on to excess weight.Individual results will 
vary. Clinical studies indicate that most people lose an average of up to 
2-5 lbs per week with Medifast. The scale isn't the only test, so check 
other indicators such as your waistline measurement and how well your 
clothes are fitting you. Individual results may vary, and are dependent 
upon various factors such as your starting weight, targeted weight-loss 
goal, level of exercise, presence of medical conditions, use of 
medications, accuracy with diet compliance, etc. As with most diets, 
Medifast suggests that you consult with your physician prior to starting a 
weight-loss program.
