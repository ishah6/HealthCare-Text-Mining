Injuries of the nail bed are the most injuries to the hand. Though many 
individuals do not take notice of the injury, prompt repair of the 
separated nail bed decreases the chances of a painful nail plate deformity.I would suggest that you consult your surgeon. Surgical repair will depend 
on the extent of the injury, signs of contamination, exposure of bone and 
the viability of the surrounding tissues. A radiograph may also be done to 
detect and underlying bone injury.
