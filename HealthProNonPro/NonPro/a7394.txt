Hun, that is a really someting u need to go see a doc. for my nephew has it and yes he is on meds. for it. But its nothin that will go away but it helps. its not all about yelling. Its movement of body parts, face movements, and sounds, its diffent things. But if u think u have it please go see a doc as soon as u can???? U need somethin to control it and help u and make u feel better. I know how u r feelin. My nephew is 16 years old and hes had it for 10 years and he was made fun of because of the noises he was makin but he could not help it until we got him on meds. Until then he didnt want to go to school or nothing.. So please go see a doc.
